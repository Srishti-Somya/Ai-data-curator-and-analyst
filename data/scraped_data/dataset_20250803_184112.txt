The Definition of Cancer
The Definition of Cancer
Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body.
Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.
Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn’t. These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous (benign).
Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel to distant places in the body to form new tumors (a process called metastasis). Cancerous tumors may also be called malignant tumors. Many cancers form solid tumors, but cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not.
Benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. When removed, benign tumors usually don’t grow back, whereas cancerous tumors sometimes do. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, however. Some can cause serious symptoms or be life threatening, such as benign tumors in the brain.

Cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways. For instance, cancer cells:
Many times, cancer cells rely so heavily on these abnormal behaviors that they can’t survive without them. Researchers have taken advantage of this fact, developing therapies that target the abnormal features of cancer cells. For example, some cancer therapies prevent blood vessels from growing toward tumors, essentially starving the tumor of needed nutrients.
Cancer is a disease caused when cells divide uncontrollably and spread into surrounding tissues.
Immune system cells can detect and attack cancer cells. But some cancer cells can avoid detection or thwart an attack. Some cancer treatments can help the immune system better detect and kill cancer cells.
How Does Cancer Develop?
How Does Cancer Develop?
Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.
Genetic changes that cause cancer can happen because:
The body normally eliminates cells with damaged DNA before they turn cancerous. But the body’s ability to do so goes down as we age. This is part of the reason why there is a higher risk of cancer later in life.
Each person’s cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes. As the cancer continues to grow, additional changes will occur. Even within the same tumor, different cells may have different genetic changes.
Cancer is caused by certain changes to genes, the basic physical units of inheritance. Genes are arranged in long strands of tightly packed DNA called chromosomes.

Cancer is caused by changes to DNA. Most cancer-causing DNA changes occur in sections of DNA called genes. These changes are also called genetic changes.
Genetic changes that cause cancer can be inherited or arise from certain environmental exposures. Genetic changes can also happen because of errors that occur as cells divide.

Most often, cancer-causing genetic changes accumulate slowly as a person ages, leading to a higher risk of cancer later in life.
Types of Genes that Cause Cancer
Types of Genes that Cause Cancer
A DNA change can cause genes involved in normal cell growth to become oncogenes. Unlike normal genes, oncogenes cannot be turned off, so they cause uncontrolled cell growth.
The genetic changes that contribute to cancer tend to affect three main types of genes—proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair genes. These changes are sometimes called “drivers” of cancer.
Proto-oncogenes are involved in normal cell growth and division. However, when these genes are altered in certain ways or are more active than normal, they may become cancer-causing genes (or oncogenes), allowing cells to grow and survive when they should not.
Tumor suppressor genes are also involved in controlling cell growth and division. Cells with certain alterations in tumor suppressor genes may divide in an uncontrolled manner.
DNA repair genes are involved in fixing damaged DNA. Cells with mutations in these genes tend to develop additional mutations in other genes and changes in their chromosomes, such as duplications and deletions of chromosome parts. Together, these mutations may cause the cells to become cancerous.
As scientists have learned more about the molecular changes that lead to cancer, they have found that certain mutations commonly occur in many types of cancer. Now there are many cancer treatments available that target gene mutations found in cancer. A few of these treatments can be used by anyone with a cancer that has the targeted mutation, no matter where the cancer started growing.
In normal cells, tumor suppressor genes prevent cancer by slowing or stopping cell growth. DNA changes that inactivate tumor suppressor genes can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer.
Each person’s cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes. Specific genetic changes may make a person’s cancer more or less likely to respond to certain treatments.
In metastasis, cancer cells break away from where they first formed and form new tumors in other parts of the body.

A cancer that has spread from the place where it first formed to another place in the body is called metastatic cancer. The process by which cancer cells spread to other parts of the body is called metastasis.
Metastatic cancer has the same name and the same type of cancer cells as the original, or primary, cancer. For example, breast cancer that forms a metastatic tumor in the lung is metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer.
Under a microscope, metastatic cancer cells generally look the same as cells of the original cancer. Moreover, metastatic cancer cells and cells of the original cancer usually have some molecular features in common, such as the presence of specific chromosome changes.
In some cases, treatment may help prolong the lives of people with metastatic cancer. In other cases, the primary goal of treatment for metastatic cancer is to control the growth of the cancer or to relieve symptoms it is causing. Metastatic tumors can cause severe damage to how the body functions, and most people who die of cancer die of metastatic disease.
Within a tumor, cancer cells are surrounded by a variety of immune cells, fibroblasts, molecules, and blood vessels—what’s known as the tumor microenvironment. Cancer cells can change the microenvironment, which in turn can affect how cancer grows and spreads.
Cancer cells can break away from the original tumor and travel through the blood or lymph system to distant locations in the body, where they exit the vessels to form additional tumors. This is called metastasis.
Tissue Changes that Are Not Cancer
Tissue Changes that Are Not Cancer
Not every change in the body’s tissues is cancer. Some tissue changes may develop into cancer if they are not treated, however. Here are some examples of tissue changes that are not cancer but, in some cases, are monitored because they could become cancer:
Normal cells may become cancer cells. Before cancer cells form in tissues of the body, the cells go through abnormal changes called hyperplasia and dysplasia. In hyperplasia, there is an increase in the number of cells in an organ or tissue that appear normal under a microscope. In dysplasia, the cells look abnormal under a microscope but are not cancer. Hyperplasia and dysplasia may or may not become cancer.

There are more than 100 types of cancer. Types of cancer are usually named for the organs or tissues where the cancers form. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and brain cancer starts in the brain. Cancers also may be described by the type of cell that formed them, such as an epithelial cell or a squamous cell.
You can search NCI’s website for information on specific types of cancer based on the cancer’s location in the body or by using our A to Z List of Cancers. We also have information on childhood cancers and cancers in adolescents and young adults.
Here are some categories of cancers that begin in specific types of cells:
Carcinomas are the most common type of cancer. They are formed by epithelial cells, which are the cells that cover the inside and outside surfaces of the body. There are many types of epithelial cells, which often have a column-like shape when viewed under a microscope.
Carcinomas that begin in different epithelial cell types have specific names:
Adenocarcinoma is a cancer that forms in epithelial cells that produce fluids or mucus. Tissues with this type of epithelial cell are sometimes called glandular tissues. Most cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate are adenocarcinomas.
Basal cell carcinoma is a cancer that begins in the lower or basal (base) layer of the epidermis, which is a person’s outer layer of skin.
Squamous cell carcinoma is a cancer that forms in squamous cells, which are epithelial cells that lie just beneath the outer surface of the skin. Squamous cells also line many other organs, including the stomach, intestines, lungs, bladder, and kidneys. Squamous cells look flat, like fish scales, when viewed under a microscope. Squamous cell carcinomas are sometimes called epidermoid carcinomas.
Transitional cell carcinoma is a cancer that forms in a type of epithelial tissue called transitional epithelium, or urothelium. This tissue, which is made up of many layers of epithelial cells that can get bigger and smaller, is found in the linings of the bladder, ureters, and part of the kidneys (renal pelvis), and a few other organs. Some cancers of the bladder, ureters, and kidneys are transitional cell carcinomas.
Soft tissue sarcoma forms in soft tissues of the body, including muscle, tendons, fat, blood vessels, lymph vessels, nerves, and tissue around joints.

Sarcomas are cancers that form in bone and soft tissues, including muscle, fat, blood vessels, lymph vessels, and fibrous tissue (such as tendons and ligaments).
Osteosarcoma is the most common cancer of bone. The most common types of soft tissue sarcoma are leiomyosarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, liposarcoma, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.
Our page on soft tissue sarcoma has more information.
Cancers that begin in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow are called leukemias. These cancers do not form solid tumors. Instead, large numbers of abnormal white blood cells (leukemia cells and leukemic blast cells) build up in the blood and bone marrow, crowding out normal blood cells. The low level of normal blood cells can make it harder for the body to get oxygen to its tissues, control bleeding, or fight infections.
There are four common types of leukemia, which are grouped based on how quickly the disease gets worse (acute or chronic) and on the type of blood cell the cancer starts in (lymphoblastic or myeloid). Acute forms of leukemia grow quickly and chronic forms grow more slowly.
Our page on leukemia has more information.
Lymphoma is cancer that begins in lymphocytes (T cells or B cells). These are disease-fighting white blood cells that are part of the immune system. In lymphoma, abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes and lymph vessels, as well as in other organs of the body.
There are two main types of lymphoma:
Hodgkin lymphoma – People with this disease have abnormal lymphocytes that are called Reed-Sternberg cells. These cells usually form from B cells.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma – This is a large group of cancers that start in lymphocytes. The cancers can grow quickly or slowly and can form from B cells or T cells.
Our page on lymphoma has more information.
Multiple myeloma is cancer that begins in plasma cells, another type of immune cell. The abnormal plasma cells, called myeloma cells, build up in the bone marrow and form tumors in bones all through the body. Multiple myeloma is also called plasma cell myeloma and Kahler disease.
Our page on multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms has more information.
Melanoma is cancer that begins in cells that become melanocytes, which are specialized cells that make melanin (the pigment that gives skin its color). Most melanomas form on the skin, but melanomas can also form in other pigmented tissues, such as the eye.
Our pages on skin cancer and intraocular melanoma have more information.
Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors
There are different types of brain and spinal cord tumors. These tumors are named based on the type of cell in which they formed and where the tumor first formed in the central nervous system. For example, an astrocytic tumor begins in star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. Brain tumors can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).
Our page on brain and spinal cord tumors has more information.
Other Types of Tumors
Germ cell tumors are a type of tumor that begins in the cells that give rise to sperm or eggs. These tumors can occur almost anywhere in the body and can be either benign or malignant.
Our page of cancers by body location/system includes a list of germ cell tumors with links to more information.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
Neuroendocrine tumors form from cells that release hormones into the blood in response to a signal from the nervous system. These tumors, which may make higher-than-normal amounts of hormones, can cause many different symptoms. Neuroendocrine tumors may be benign or malignant.
Our definition of neuroendocrine tumors has more information.
Carcinoid tumors are a type of neuroendocrine tumor. They are slow-growing tumors that are usually found in the gastrointestinal system (most often in the rectum and small intestine). Carcinoid tumors may spread to the liver or other sites in the body, and they may secrete substances such as serotonin or prostaglandins, causing carcinoid syndrome.
Our page on gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors has more information.
- grow in the absence of signals telling them to grow. Normal cells only grow when they receive such signals.
- ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or to die (a process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis).
- invade into nearby areas and spread to other areas of the body. Normal cells stop growing when they encounter other cells, and most normal cells do not move around the body.
- tell blood vessels to grow toward tumors.  These blood vessels supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products from tumors.
- hide from the immune system. The immune system normally eliminates damaged or abnormal cells.
- trick the immune system into helping cancer cells stay alive and grow. For instance, some cancer cells convince immune cells to protect the tumor instead of attacking it.
- accumulate multiple changes in their chromosomes, such as duplications and deletions of chromosome parts. Some cancer cells have double the normal number of chromosomes.
- rely on different kinds of nutrients than normal cells. In addition, some cancer cells make energy from nutrients in a different way than most normal cells. This lets cancer cells grow more quickly.
- of errors that occur as cells divide.
- of damage to DNA caused by harmful substances in the environment, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke and ultraviolet rays from the sun. (Our Cancer Causes and Prevention section has more information.)
- they were inherited from our parents.
- Hyperplasia occurs when cells within a tissue multiply faster than normal and extra cells build up. However, the cells and the way the tissue is organized still look normal under a microscope. Hyperplasia can be caused by several factors or conditions, including chronic irritation.
- Dysplasia is a more advanced condition than hyperplasia. In dysplasia, there is also a buildup of extra cells. But the cells look abnormal and there are changes in how the tissue is organized. In general, the more abnormal the cells and tissue look, the greater the chance that cancer will form. Some types of dysplasia may need to be monitored or treated, but others do not. An example of dysplasia is an abnormal mole (called a dysplastic nevus) that forms on the skin. A dysplastic nevus can turn into melanoma, although most do not.
- Carcinoma in situ is an even more advanced condition. Although it is sometimes called stage 0 cancer, it is not cancer because the abnormal cells do not invade nearby tissue the way that cancer cells do. But because some carcinomas in situ may become cancer, they are usually treated.

==================================================
Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[2][7] These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread.[7] Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss, and a change in bowel movements.[1] While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they can also have other causes.[1] Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.[7][8]
About 33% of deaths from cancer are caused by tobacco and alcohol consumption, obesity, lack of fruit and vegetables in diet and lack of exercise.[2][9][10] Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation, and environmental pollutants.[3] Infection with specific viruses, bacteria and parasites is an environmental factor causing approximately 16–18% of cancers worldwide.[11] These infectious agents include Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HPV, Epstein–Barr virus, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Merkel cell polyomavirus. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not directly cause cancer but it causes immune deficiency that can magnify the risk due to other infections, sometimes up to several thousandfold (in the case of Kaposi's sarcoma). Importantly, vaccination against the hepatitis B virus and the human papillomavirus have been shown to nearly eliminate the risk of cancers caused by these viruses in persons successfully vaccinated prior to infection.
These environmental factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell.[12] Typically, many genetic changes are required before cancer develops.[12] Approximately 5–10% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects.[13] Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests.[2] It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy.[14]
The risk of developing certain cancers can be reduced by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol intake, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, limiting consumption of processed meat and red meat, and limiting exposure to direct sunlight.[15][16] Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer.[12] The benefits of screening for breast cancer are controversial.[12][17] Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy.[2][4] More personalized therapies that harness a patient's immune system are emerging in the field of cancer immunotherapy.[18] Palliative care is a medical specialty that delivers advanced pain and symptom management, which may be particularly important in those with advanced disease..[2] The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment.[12] In children under 15 at diagnosis, the five-year survival rate in the developed world is on average 80%.[19] For cancer in the United States, the average five-year survival rate is 66% for all ages.[5]
In 2015, about 90.5 million people worldwide had cancer.[20] In 2019, annual cancer cases grew by 23.6 million people, and there were 10 million deaths worldwide, representing over the previous decade increases of 26% and 21%, respectively.[6][21]
The most common types of cancer in males are lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and stomach cancer.[22][23] In females, the most common types are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer.[12][23] If skin cancer other than melanoma were included in total new cancer cases each year, it would account for around 40% of cases.[24][25] In children, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and brain tumors are most common, except in Africa, where non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurs more often.[19] In 2012, about 165,000 children under 15 years of age were diagnosed with cancer.[22] The risk of cancer increases significantly with age, and many cancers occur more commonly in developed countries.[12] Rates are increasing as more people live to an old age and as lifestyle changes occur in the developing world.[26] The global total economic costs of cancer were estimated at US$1.16 trillion (equivalent to $1.67 trillion in 2024) per year as of 2010[update].[27]
Etymology and definitions
The word comes from the ancient Greek καρκίνος, meaning 'crab' and 'tumor'. Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen, among others, noted the similarity of crabs to some tumors with swollen veins. The word was introduced in English in the modern medical sense around 1600.[28]
Cancers comprise a large family of diseases that involve abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[2][7] They form a subset of neoplasms. A neoplasm or tumor is a group of cells that have undergone unregulated growth and will often form a mass or lump, but may be distributed diffusely.[29][30]
All tumor cells show the six hallmarks of cancer. These characteristics are required to produce a malignant tumor. They include:[31]
The progression from normal cells to cells that can form a detectable mass to cancer involves multiple steps known as malignant progression.[31][32]
When cancer begins, it produces no symptoms. Signs and symptoms appear as the mass grows or ulcerates. The findings that result depend on cancer's type and location. Few symptoms are specific. Many frequently occur in individuals who have other conditions. Cancer can be difficult to diagnose and can be considered a "great imitator".[33]
People may become anxious or depressed post-diagnosis. The risk of suicide in people with cancer is approximately double.[34]
Local symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration. For example, mass effects from lung cancer can block the bronchus resulting in cough or pneumonia; esophageal cancer can cause narrowing of the esophagus, making it difficult or painful to swallow; and colorectal cancer may lead to narrowing or blockages in the bowel, affecting bowel habits. Masses in breasts or testicles may produce observable lumps. Ulceration can cause bleeding that can lead to symptoms such as coughing up blood (lung cancer), anemia or rectal bleeding (colon cancer), blood in the urine (bladder cancer), or abnormal vaginal bleeding (endometrial or cervical cancer). Although localized pain may occur in advanced cancer, the initial tumor is usually painless. Some cancers can cause a buildup of fluid within the chest or abdomen.[33]
Systemic symptoms may occur due to the body's response to the cancer. This may include fatigue, unintentional weight loss, or skin changes.[35] Some cancers can cause a systemic inflammatory state that leads to ongoing muscle loss and weakness, known as cachexia.[36]
Some cancers, such as Hodgkin's disease, leukemias, and liver or kidney cancers, can cause a persistent fever.[33]
Shortness of breath, called dyspnea, is a common symptom of cancer and its treatment. The causes of cancer-related dyspnea can include tumors in or around the lung, blocked airways, fluid in the lungs, pneumonia, or treatment reactions including an allergic response.[37] Treatment for dyspnea in patients with advanced cancer can include fans, bilevel ventilation, acupressure/reflexology and multicomponent nonpharmacological interventions.[38]
Some systemic symptoms of cancer are caused by hormones or other molecules produced by the tumor, known as paraneoplastic syndromes. Common paraneoplastic syndromes include hypercalcemia, which can cause altered mental state, constipation and dehydration, or hyponatremia, which can also cause altered mental status, vomiting, headaches, or seizures.[39]
Metastasis is the spread of cancer to other locations in the body. The dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors, while the original is called the primary tumor. Almost all cancers can metastasize.[40] Most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has metastasized.[41]
Metastasis is common in the late stages of cancer and it can occur via the blood or the lymphatic system or both. The typical steps in metastasis are:
Different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs. Overall, the most common places for metastases to occur are the lungs, liver, brain, and the bones.[40]
While some cancers can be cured if detected early, metastatic cancer is more difficult to treat and control. Nevertheless, some recent treatments are demonstrating encouraging results.[42]
The majority of cancers, some 90–95% of cases, are due to genetic mutations from environmental and lifestyle factors.[3] The remaining 5–10% are due to inherited genetics.[3] Environmental refers to any cause that is not inherited, such as lifestyle, economic, and behavioral factors and not merely pollution.[44] Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include tobacco use (25–30%), diet and obesity (30–35%), infections (15–20%), radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%), lack of physical activity, and pollution.[3][45] Psychological stress does not appear to be a risk factor for the onset of cancer,[46][47] though it may worsen outcomes in those who already have cancer.[46]
Environmental or lifestyle factors that caused cancer to develop in an individual can be identified by analyzing mutational signatures from genomic sequencing of tumor DNA. For example, this can reveal if lung cancer was caused by tobacco smoke, if skin cancer was caused by UV radiation, or if secondary cancers were caused by previous chemotherapy treatment.[48]
Cancer is generally not a transmissible disease.[49] Exceptions include rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and occasional organ donors. However, transmissible infectious diseases such as hepatitis B, Epstein–Barr, HPV and AIDS infections, can contribute to the development of cancer.[50]
Exposure to particular substances have been linked to specific types of cancer. These substances are called carcinogens.
Tobacco smoke, for example, causes 90% of lung cancer.[51] Tobacco use can cause cancer throughout the body including in the mouth and throat, larynx, esophagus, stomach, bladder, kidney, cervix, colon/rectum, liver and pancreas.[52][53] Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.[54]
Tobacco is responsible for about one in five cancer deaths worldwide[54] and about one in three in the developed world.[55]
Lung cancer death rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990.[56][57]
Alcohol increases the risk of cancer of the breast (in women), throat, liver, oesophagus, mouth, larynx, and colon.[58]
In Western Europe, 10% of cancers in males and 3% of cancers in females are attributed to alcohol exposure, especially liver and digestive tract cancers.[59] Cancer from work-related substance exposures may cause between 2 and 20% of cases,[60] causing at least 200,000 deaths.[61] Cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma can come from inhaling tobacco smoke or asbestos fibers, or leukemia from exposure to benzene.[61]
Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which is predominantly used in the production of Teflon, is known to cause two kinds of cancer.[62][63]
Chemotherapy drugs such as platinum-based compounds are carcinogens that increase the risk of secondary cancers.[48]
Azathioprine, an immunosuppressive medication, is a carcinogen that can cause primary tumors to develop.[48]
Diet, physical inactivity, and obesity are related to up to 30–35% of cancer deaths.[3][64] In the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of cancer deaths.[64] A UK study including data on over 5 million people showed higher body mass index to be related to at least 10 types of cancer and responsible for around 12,000 cases each year in that country.[65] Physical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk, not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on the immune system and endocrine system.[64] More than half of the effect from the diet is due to overnutrition (eating too much), rather than from eating too few vegetables or other healthful foods.[citation needed]
Some specific foods are linked to specific cancers. A high-salt diet is linked to gastric cancer.[66] Aflatoxin B1, a frequent food contaminant, causes liver cancer.[66] Betel nut chewing can cause oral cancer.[66] National differences in dietary practices may partly explain differences in cancer incidence. For example, gastric cancer is more common in Japan due to its high-salt diet[67] while colon cancer is more common in the United States. Immigrant cancer profiles mirror those of their new country, often within one generation.[68]
Worldwide, approximately 18% of cancer deaths are related to infectious diseases.[3] This proportion ranges from a high of 25% in Africa to less than 10% in the developed world.[3] Viruses[69] are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but bacteria and parasites may also play a role. Oncoviruses (viruses that can cause human cancer) include:
Bacterial infection may also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in
Parasitic infections associated with cancer include:
Radiation exposure such as ultraviolet radiation and radioactive material is a risk factor for cancer.[73][74][75] Many non-melanoma skin cancers are due to ultraviolet radiation, mostly from sunlight.[74] Sources of ionizing radiation include medical imaging and radon gas.[74]
Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.[76] Residential exposure to radon gas, for example, has similar cancer risks as passive smoking. Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon plus tobacco smoke. Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals and at any age. Children are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.[76]
Medical use of ionizing radiation is a small but growing source of radiation-induced cancers. Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer.[76] It is also used in some kinds of medical imaging.[77]
Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies.[78] Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB, as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.[78]
Non-ionizing radio frequency radiation from mobile phones, electric power transmission and other similar sources has been described as a possible carcinogen by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer.[79] Evidence, however, has not supported a concern.[80][73] This includes that studies have not found a consistent link between mobile phone radiation and cancer risk.[81]
The vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary (sporadic). Hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. Less than 0.3% of the population are carriers of a genetic mutation that has a large effect on cancer risk and these cause less than 3–10% of cancer.[82] Some of these syndromes include: certain inherited mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 with a more than 75% risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer,[82] and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome), which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer,[83] among others.
Statistically for cancers causing most mortality, the relative risk of developing colorectal cancer when a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has been diagnosed with it is about 2.[84] The corresponding relative risk is 1.5 for lung cancer,[85] and 1.9 for prostate cancer.[86] For breast cancer, the relative risk is 1.8 with a first-degree relative having developed it at 50 years of age or older, and 3.3 when the relative developed it when being younger than 50 years of age.[87]
Taller people have an increased risk of cancer because they have more cells than shorter people. Since height is genetically determined to a large extent, taller people have a heritable increase in cancer risk.[88]
Some substances cause cancer primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects.[89] A prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos, naturally occurring mineral fibers that are a major cause of mesothelioma (cancer of the serous membrane) usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs.[89] Other substances in this category, including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers, such as wollastonite, attapulgite, glass wool and rock wool, are believed to have similar effects.[89] Non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel and crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite and tridymite).[89] Usually, physical carcinogens must get inside the body (such as through inhalation) and require years of exposure to produce cancer.[89]
Physical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.[90] Claims that breaking bones resulted in bone cancer, for example, have not been proven.[90] Similarly, physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer, breast cancer or brain cancer.[90] One accepted source is frequent, long-term application of hot objects to the body. It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by kanger and kairo heaters (charcoal hand warmers), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.[90] Frequent consumption of scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.[90] Generally, it is believed that cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of healing, rather than directly by the trauma.[90] However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation.[citation needed]
Chronic inflammation has been hypothesized to directly cause mutation.[90][91] Inflammation can contribute to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and migration of cancer cells by influencing the tumor microenvironment.[92][93] Oncogenes build up an inflammatory pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.[94]
Hormones also play a role in the development of cancer by promoting cell proliferation.[95] Insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins play a key role in cancer cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting possible involvement in carcinogenesis.[96]
Hormones are important agents in sex-related cancers, such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary and testis and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer.[95] For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain their higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.[95] Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of European ancestry and have a correspondingly higher level of prostate cancer.[95] Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating androstanediol glucuronide, have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.[95]
Other factors are relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.[95] Women who take hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.[95] On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones and lower risk of cancer.[95] Osteosarcoma may be promoted by growth hormones.[95] Some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers.[95]
There is an association between celiac disease and an increased risk of all cancers. People with untreated celiac disease have a higher risk, but this risk decreases with time after diagnosis and strict treatment. This may be due to the adoption of a gluten-free diet, which seems to have a protective role against the development of malignancy in people with celiac disease. However, the delay in diagnosis and initiation of a gluten-free diet seems to increase the risk of malignancies.[97] Rates of gastrointestinal cancers are increased in people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, due to chronic inflammation. Immunomodulators and biologic agents used to treat these diseases may promote the development of extra-intestinal malignancies.[98]
Cancer is fundamentally a disease of tissue growth regulation. For a normal cell to transform into a cancer cell, the genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation must be altered.[99]
The affected genes are divided into two broad categories. Oncogenes are genes that promote cell growth and reproduction. Tumor suppressor genes are genes that inhibit cell division and survival. Malignant transformation can occur through the formation of novel oncogenes, the inappropriate over-expression of normal oncogenes, or by the under-expression or disabling of tumor suppressor genes. Typically, changes in multiple genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.[100]
Genetic changes can occur at different levels and by different mechanisms. The gain or loss of an entire chromosome can occur through errors in mitosis. More common are mutations, which are changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA.
Large-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome. Genomic amplification occurs when a cell gains copies (often 20 or more) of a small chromosomal locus, usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material. Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location. A well-known example of this is the Philadelphia chromosome, or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia and results in production of the BCR-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase.
Small-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which may occur in the promoter region of a gene and affect its expression, or may occur in the gene's coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein product. Disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retrovirus, leading to the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants.
Replication of the data contained within the DNA of living cells will probabilistically result in some errors (mutations). Complex error correction and prevention are built into the process and safeguard the cell against cancer. If a significant error occurs, the damaged cell can self-destruct through programmed cell death, termed apoptosis. If the error control processes fail, then the mutations will survive and be passed along to daughter cells.
Some environments make errors more likely to arise and propagate. Such environments can include the presence of disruptive substances called carcinogens, repeated physical injury, heat, ionising radiation, or hypoxia.[101]
The errors that cause cancer are self-amplifying and compounding, for example:
The transformation of a normal cell into cancer is akin to a chain reaction caused by initial errors, which compound into more severe errors, each progressively allowing the cell to escape more controls that limit normal tissue growth. This rebellion-like scenario is an undesirable survival of the fittest, where the driving forces of evolution work against the body's design and enforcement of order. Once cancer has begun to develop, this ongoing process, termed clonal evolution, drives progression towards more invasive stages.[102] Clonal evolution leads to intra-tumour heterogeneity (cancer cells with heterogeneous mutations) that complicates designing effective treatment strategies and requires an evolutionary approach to designing treatment.
Characteristic abilities developed by cancers are divided into categories, specifically evasion of apoptosis, self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, sustained angiogenesis, limitless replicative potential, metastasis, reprogramming of energy metabolism and evasion of immune destruction.[31][32]
The classical view of cancer is a set of diseases driven by progressive genetic abnormalities that include mutations in tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes, and in chromosomal abnormalities. A role for epigenetic alterations was identified in the early 21st century.[103]
Epigenetic alterations are functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not change the nucleotide sequence. Examples of such modifications are changes in DNA methylation (hypermethylation and hypomethylation), histone modification[104] and changes in chromosomal architecture (caused by inappropriate expression of proteins such as HMGA2 or HMGA1).[105] Each of these alterations regulates gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These changes may remain through cell divisions, endure for multiple generations, and can be considered as equivalent to mutations.
Epigenetic alterations occur frequently in cancers. As an example, one study listed protein coding genes that were frequently altered in their methylation in association with colon cancer. These included 147 hypermethylated and 27 hypomethylated genes. Of the hypermethylated genes, 10 were hypermethylated in 100% of colon cancers and many others were hypermethylated in more than 50% of colon cancers.[106]
While epigenetic alterations are found in cancers, the epigenetic alterations in DNA repair genes, causing reduced expression of DNA repair proteins, may be of particular importance. Such alterations may occur early in the progression to cancer and are a possible cause of the genetic instability characteristic of cancers.[107][108][109]
Reduced expression of DNA repair genes disrupts DNA repair. This is shown in the figure at the 4th level from the top. (In the figure, red wording indicates the central role of DNA damage and defects in DNA repair in the progression to cancer.) When DNA repair is deficient DNA damage remains in cells at a higher than usual level (5th level) and causes increased frequencies of mutation and/or epimutation (6th level). Mutation rates increase substantially in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair[110][111] or in homologous recombinational repair (HRR).[112] Chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy also increase in HRR defective cells.[113]
Higher levels of DNA damage cause increased mutation (right side of figure) and increased epimutation. During repair of DNA double strand breaks, or repair of other DNA damage, incompletely cleared repair sites can cause epigenetic gene silencing.[114][115]
Deficient expression of DNA repair proteins due to an inherited mutation can increase cancer risks. Individuals with an inherited impairment in any of 34 DNA repair genes (see article DNA repair-deficiency disorder) have increased cancer risk, with some defects ensuring a 100% lifetime chance of cancer (e.g. p53 mutations).[116] Germline DNA repair mutations are noted on the figure's left side. However, such germline mutations (which cause highly penetrant cancer syndromes) are the cause of only about 1 percent of cancers.[117]
In sporadic cancers, deficiencies in DNA repair are occasionally caused by a mutation in a DNA repair gene but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes. This is indicated in the figure at the 3rd level. Many studies of heavy metal-induced carcinogenesis show that such heavy metals cause a reduction in expression of DNA repair enzymes, some through epigenetic mechanisms. DNA repair inhibition is proposed to be a predominant mechanism in heavy metal-induced carcinogenicity. In addition, frequent epigenetic alterations of the DNA sequences code for small RNAs called microRNAs (or miRNAs). miRNAs do not code for proteins, but can "target" protein-coding genes and reduce their expression.
Cancers usually arise from an assemblage of mutations and epimutations that confer a selective advantage leading to clonal expansion (see Field defects in progression to cancer). Mutations, however, may not be as frequent in cancers as epigenetic alterations. An average cancer of the breast or colon can have about 60 to 70 protein-altering mutations, of which about three or four may be "driver" mutations and the remaining ones may be "passenger" mutations.[118]
Metastasis is the spread of cancer to other locations in the body. The dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors, while the original is called the primary tumor. Almost all cancers can metastasize.[40] Most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has metastasized.[41]
Metastasis is common in the late stages of cancer and it can occur via the blood or the lymphatic system or both. The typical steps in metastasis are local invasion, intravasation into the blood or lymph, circulation through the body, extravasation into the new tissue, proliferation and angiogenesis. Different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs, but overall the most common places for metastases to occur are the lungs, liver, brain and the bones.[40]
Normal cells typically generate about 30% of energy from glycolysis,[119] whereas most cancers rely on glycolysis for energy production (Warburg effect).[120][121] But a minority of cancer types rely on oxidative phosphorylation as the primary energy source, including lymphoma, leukemia, and endometrial cancer.[122] Even in these cases, however,[clarification needed] the use of glycolysis as an energy source rarely exceeds 60%.[119] A few cancers use glutamine as the major energy source, partly because it provides nitrogen required for nucleotide (DNA, RNA) synthesis.[123] Cancer stem cells often use oxidative phosphorylation or glutamine as a primary energy source.[124]
Most cancers are initially recognized either because of the appearance of signs or symptoms or through screening.[125] Neither of these leads to a definitive diagnosis, which requires the examination of a tissue sample by a pathologist.[126] People with suspected cancer are investigated with medical tests. These commonly include blood tests, X-rays, (contrast) CT scans and endoscopy.
The tissue diagnosis from the biopsy indicates the type of cell that is proliferating, its histological grade, genetic abnormalities and other features. Together, this information is useful to evaluate the prognosis and to choose the best treatment.
Cytogenetics and immunohistochemistry are other types of tissue tests. These tests provide information about molecular changes (such as mutations, fusion genes and numerical chromosome changes) and may thus also indicate the prognosis and best treatment.
Cancer diagnosis can cause psychological distress and psychosocial interventions, such as talking therapy, may help people with this.[127]  Some people choose to disclose the diagnosis widely; others prefer to keep the information private, especially shortly after the diagnosis, or to disclose it only partially or to selected people.[128]
Cancers are classified by the type of cell that the tumor cells resemble and is therefore presumed to be the origin of the tumor. These types include:
Cancers are usually named using -carcinoma, -sarcoma or -blastoma as a suffix, with the Latin or Greek word for the organ or tissue of origin as the root. For example, cancers of the liver parenchyma arising from malignant epithelial cells is called hepatocarcinoma, while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a hepatoblastoma and a cancer arising from fat cells is called a liposarcoma. For some common cancers, the English organ name is used. For example, the most common type of breast cancer is called ductal carcinoma of the breast. Here, the adjective ductal refers to the appearance of cancer under the microscope, which suggests that it has originated in the milk ducts.
Benign tumors (which are not cancers) are named using -oma as a suffix with the organ name as the root. For example, a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a leiomyoma (the common name of this frequently occurring benign tumor in the uterus is fibroid). Confusingly, some types of cancer use the -noma suffix, examples including melanoma and seminoma.
Some types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as giant cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma.
Cancer prevention is defined as active measures to decrease cancer risk.[132] The vast majority of cancer cases are due to environmental risk factors. Many of these environmental factors are controllable lifestyle choices. Thus, cancer is generally preventable.[133] Between 70% and 90% of common cancers are due to environmental factors and therefore potentially preventable.[134]
Greater than 30% of cancer deaths could be prevented by avoiding risk factors including: tobacco, excess weight/obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, alcohol, sexually transmitted infections and air pollution.[135] Further, poverty could be considered as an indirect risk factor in human cancers.[136] Not all environmental causes are controllable, such as naturally occurring background radiation and cancers caused through hereditary genetic disorders and thus are not preventable via personal behavior.
In 2019, ~44% of all cancer deaths – or ~4.5 M deaths or ~105 million lost disability-adjusted life years – were due to known clearly preventable risk factors, led by smoking, alcohol use and high BMI, according to a GBD systematic analysis.[131]
While many dietary recommendations have been proposed to reduce cancer risks, the evidence to support them is not definitive.[15][137] The primary dietary factors that increase risk are obesity and alcohol consumption. Diets low in fruits and vegetables and high in red meat have been implicated but reviews and meta-analyses do not come to a consistent conclusion.[138][139] A 2014 meta-analysis found no relationship between fruits and vegetables and cancer.[140] Coffee is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer.[141] Studies have linked excessive consumption of red or processed meat to an increased risk of breast cancer, colon cancer and pancreatic cancer, a phenomenon that could be due to the presence of carcinogens in meats cooked at high temperatures.[142][143] In 2015 the IARC reported that eating processed meat (e.g., bacon, ham, hot dogs, sausages) and, to a lesser degree, red meat was linked to some cancers.[144][145]
Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on vegetables, fruit, whole grains and fish and an avoidance of processed and red meat (beef, pork, lamb), animal fats, pickled foods and refined carbohydrates.[15][137]
Medications can be used to prevent cancer in a few circumstances.[146][147] In the general population, NSAIDs reduce the risk of colorectal cancer; however, due to cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects, they cause overall harm when used for prevention.[148] Aspirin has been found to reduce the risk of death from cancer by about 7%.[149] COX-2 inhibitors may decrease the rate of polyp formation in people with familial adenomatous polyposis; however, it is associated with the same adverse effects as NSAIDs.[150] Daily use of tamoxifen or raloxifene reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women.[151] The benefit versus harm for 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor such as finasteride is not clear.[152]
Vitamin supplementation does not appear to be effective at preventing cancer.[153] While low blood levels of vitamin D are correlated with increased cancer risk,[154][155][156] whether this relationship is causal and vitamin D supplementation is protective is not determined.[157][158] One 2014 review found that supplements had no significant effect on cancer risk.[158] Another 2014 review concluded that vitamin D3 may decrease the risk of death from cancer (one fewer death in 150 people treated over 5 years), but concerns with the quality of the data were noted.[159]
Beta-Carotene supplementation increases lung cancer rates in those who are high risk.[160] Folic acid supplementation is not effective in preventing colon cancer and may increase colon polyps.[161] Selenium supplementation has not been shown to reduce the risk of cancer.[162]
Vaccines have been developed that prevent infection by some carcinogenic viruses.[163] Human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil and Cervarix) decrease the risk of developing cervical cancer.[163] The hepatitis B vaccine prevents infection with hepatitis B virus and thus decreases the risk of liver cancer.[163] The administration of human papillomavirus and hepatitis B vaccinations is recommended where resources allow.[164]
Unlike diagnostic efforts prompted by symptoms and medical signs, cancer screening involves efforts to detect cancer after it has formed, but before any noticeable symptoms appear.[165] This may involve physical examination, blood or urine tests or medical imaging.[165]
Cancer screening is not available for many types of cancers. Even when tests are available, they may not be recommended for everyone. Universal screening or mass screening involves screening everyone.[166] Selective screening identifies people who are at higher risk, such as people with a family history.[166] Several factors are considered to determine whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks and the costs of screening.[165] These factors include:
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issues recommendations for various cancers:
Screens for gastric cancer using photofluorography due to the high incidence there.[26]
Genetic testing for individuals at high risk of certain cancers is recommended by unofficial groups.[164][180] Carriers of these mutations may then undergo enhanced surveillance, chemoprevention, or preventative surgery to reduce their subsequent risk.[180]
Many treatment options for cancer exist. The primary ones include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy and palliative care. Which treatments are used depends on the type, location and grade of the cancer as well as the patient's health and preferences. The treatment intent may or may not be curative.[citation needed]
Chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with one or more cytotoxic anti-neoplastic drugs (chemotherapeutic agents) as part of a standardized regimen. The term encompasses a variety of drugs, which are divided into broad categories such as alkylating agents and antimetabolites.[181] Traditional chemotherapeutic agents act by killing cells that divide rapidly, a critical property of most cancer cells.
It was found that providing combined cytotoxic drugs is better than a single drug, a process called the combination therapy, which has an advantage in the statistics of survival and response to the tumor and in the progress of the disease.[182] A Cochrane review concluded that combined therapy was more effective in treating metastasized breast cancer. However, generally it is not certain whether combination chemotherapy leads to better health outcomes, when both survival and toxicity are considered.[183]
Targeted therapy is a form of chemotherapy that targets specific molecular differences between cancer and normal cells. The first targeted therapies blocked the estrogen receptor molecule, inhibiting the growth of breast cancer. Another common example is the class of Bcr-Abl inhibitors, which are used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).[4] Currently, targeted therapies exist for many of the most common cancer types, including bladder cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, leukemia, liver cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, and thyroid cancer as well as other cancer types.[4]
The efficacy of chemotherapy depends on the type of cancer and the stage. In combination with surgery, chemotherapy has proven useful in cancer types including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer and certain lung cancers.[184] Chemotherapy is curative for some cancers, such as some leukemias,[185][186] ineffective in some brain tumors,[187] and needless in others, such as most non-melanoma skin cancers.[188] The effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by its toxicity to other tissues in the body. Even when chemotherapy does not provide a permanent cure, it may be useful to reduce symptoms such as pain or to reduce the size of an inoperable tumor in the hope that surgery will become possible in the future.[citation needed]
Radiation therapy involves the use of ionizing radiation in an attempt to either cure or improve symptoms. It works by damaging the DNA of cancerous tissue, causing mitotic catastrophe resulting in the death of the cancer cells.[189] To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs, which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from multiple exposure angles to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger dose there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. As with chemotherapy, cancers vary in their response to radiation therapy.[190][191][192]
Radiation therapy is used in about half of cases. The radiation can be either from internal sources (brachytherapy) or external sources. The radiation is most commonly low energy X-rays for treating skin cancers, while higher energy X-rays are used for cancers within the body.[193] Radiation is typically used in addition to surgery and/or chemotherapy. For certain types of cancer, such as early head and neck cancer, it may be used alone.[194] Radiation therapy after surgery for brain metastases has been shown to not improve overall survival in patients compared to surgery alone.[195] For painful bone metastasis, radiation therapy has been found to be effective in about 70% of patients.[194]
Surgery is the primary method of treatment for most isolated, solid cancers and may play a role in palliation and prolongation of survival. It is typically an important part of the definitive diagnosis and staging of tumors, as biopsies are usually required. In localized cancer, surgery typically attempts to remove the entire mass along with, in certain cases, the lymph nodes in the area. For some types of cancer this is sufficient to eliminate the cancer.[184]
Palliative care is treatment that attempts to help the patient feel better and may be combined with an attempt to treat the cancer. Palliative care includes action to reduce physical, emotional, spiritual and psycho-social distress. Unlike treatment that is aimed at directly killing cancer cells, the primary goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life.
People at all stages of cancer treatment typically receive some kind of palliative care. In some cases, medical specialty professional organizations recommend that patients and physicians respond to cancer only with palliative care. This applies to patients who:[196]
Palliative care may be confused with hospice and therefore only indicated when people approach end of life. Like hospice care, palliative care attempts to help the patient cope with their immediate needs and to increase comfort. Unlike hospice care, palliative care does not require people to stop treatment aimed at the cancer.[citation needed]
Multiple national medical guidelines recommend early palliative care for patients whose cancer has produced distressing symptoms or who need help coping with their illness. In patients first diagnosed with metastatic disease, palliative care may be immediately indicated. Palliative care is indicated for patients with a prognosis of less than 12 months of life even given aggressive treatment.[197][198][199]
A variety of therapies using immunotherapy, stimulating or helping the immune system to fight cancer, have come into use since 1997. Approaches include:[200]
Laser therapy uses high-intensity light to treat cancer by shrinking or destroying tumors or precancerous growths. Lasers are most commonly used to treat superficial cancers that are on the surface of the body or the lining of internal organs. It is used to treat basal cell skin cancer and the very early stages of others like cervical, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and non-small cell lung cancer. It is often combined with other treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT), or interstitial laser photocoagulation, uses lasers to treat some cancers using hyperthermia, which uses heat to shrink tumors by damaging or killing cancer cells. Laser are more precise than surgery and cause less damage, pain, bleeding, swelling, and scarring. A disadvantage is that surgeons must have specialized training. It may be more expensive than other treatments.[201]
Complementary and alternative cancer treatments are a diverse group of therapies, practices and products that are not part of conventional medicine.[202] "Complementary medicine" refers to methods and substances used along with conventional medicine, while "alternative medicine" refers to compounds used instead of conventional medicine.[203] Most complementary and alternative medicines for cancer have not been studied or tested using conventional techniques such as clinical trials. Some alternative treatments have been investigated and shown to be ineffective but still continue to be marketed and promoted. Cancer researcher Andrew J. Vickers stated, "The label 'unproven' is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been 'disproven'."[204]
Survival rates vary by cancer type and by the stage at which it is diagnosed, ranging from majority survival to complete mortality five years after diagnosis. Once a cancer has metastasized, prognosis normally becomes much worse. About half of patients receiving treatment for invasive cancer (excluding carcinoma in situ and non-melanoma skin cancers) die from that cancer or its treatment.[26] A majority of cancer deaths are due to metastases of the primary tumor.[206]
Survival is worse in the developing world,[26] partly because the types of cancer that are most common there are harder to treat than those associated with developed countries.[207]
Those who survive cancer develop a second primary cancer at about twice the rate of those never diagnosed.[208] The increased risk is believed to be due to the random chance of developing any cancer, the likelihood of surviving the first cancer, the same risk factors that produced the first cancer, unwanted side effects of treating the first cancer (particularly radiation therapy), and better compliance with screening.[208]
Predicting short- or long-term survival depends on many factors. The most important are the cancer type and the patient's age and overall health. Those who are frail with other health problems have lower survival rates than otherwise healthy people. Centenarians are unlikely to survive for five years even if treatment is successful. People who report a higher quality of life tend to survive longer.[209] People with lower quality of life may be affected by depression and other complications and/or disease progression that both impairs quality and quantity of life. Additionally, patients with worse prognoses may be depressed or report poorer quality of life because they perceive that their condition is likely to be fatal.[citation needed]
People with cancer have an increased risk of blood clots in their veins which can be life-threatening.[210] The use of blood thinners such as heparin decrease the risk of blood clots but have not been shown to increase survival in people with cancer.[210] People who take blood thinners also have an increased risk of bleeding.[210]
Although extremely rare, some forms of cancer, even from an advanced stage, can heal spontaneously. This phenomenon is known as spontaneous remission.[211]
Estimates are that in 2018, 18.1 million new cases of cancer and 9.6 million deaths occur globally.[213] About 20% of males and 17% of females will get cancer at some point in time while 13% of males and 9% of females will die from it.[213]
In 2008, approximately 12.7 million cancers were diagnosed (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers and other non-invasive cancers)[26] and in 2010 nearly 7.98 million people died.[214] Cancers account for almost one in six deaths. The cancers causing the most deaths, as of 2020 are lung cancer (1.8 million), colorectal cancer (916,000), liver cancer (830,000), stomach cancer (769,000) and breast cancer (685,000).[2] This makes invasive cancer the leading cause of death in the developed world and the second leading in the developing world.[26] Over half of these cases occur in the developing world.[26]
Deaths from cancer were 5.8 million in 1990.[214] Deaths have been increasing primarily due to longer lifespans and lifestyle changes in the developing world.[26] The most significant risk factor for developing cancer is age.[215] Although it is possible for cancer to strike at any age, most patients with invasive cancer are over 65.[215] According to cancer researcher Robert A. Weinberg, "If we lived long enough, sooner or later we all would get cancer."[216] Some of the association between aging and cancer is attributed to immunosenescence,[217] errors accumulated in DNA over a lifetime[218] and age-related changes in the endocrine system.[219] Aging's effect on cancer is complicated by factors such as DNA damage and inflammation promoting it and factors such as vascular aging and endocrine changes inhibiting it.[220]
Some slow-growing cancers are particularly common, but often are not fatal. Autopsy studies in Europe and Asia showed that up to 36% of people have undiagnosed and apparently harmless thyroid cancer at the time of their deaths and that 80% of men develop prostate cancer by age 80.[221][222] As these cancers do not cause the patient's death, identifying them would have represented overdiagnosis rather than useful medical care.[citation needed]
The three most common childhood cancers are leukemia (34%), brain tumors (23%) and lymphomas (12%).[223] In the United States cancer affects about 1 in 285 children.[224] Rates of childhood cancer increased by 0.6% per year between 1975 and 2002 in the United States[225] and by 1.1% per year between 1978 and 1997 in Europe.[223] Death from childhood cancer decreased by half between 1975 and 2010 in the United States.[224]
Cancer has existed for all of human history.[226] The earliest written record regarding cancer is from c. 1600 BC in the Egyptian Edwin Smith Papyrus and describes breast cancer.[226] Hippocrates (c. 460 BC – c. 370 BC) described several kinds of cancer, referring to them with the Greek word καρκίνος karkinos (crab or crayfish).[226] This name comes from the appearance of the cut surface of a solid malignant tumor, with "the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet, whence it derives its name".[227] Galen stated that "cancer of the breast is so called because of the fancied resemblance to a crab given by the lateral prolongations of the tumor and the adjacent distended veins".[228]: 738  Celsus (c. 25 BC – 50 AD) translated karkinos into the Latin cancer, also meaning crab and recommended surgery as treatment.[226] Galen (2nd century AD) disagreed with the use of surgery and recommended purgatives instead.[226] These recommendations largely stood for 1000 years.[226]
In the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, it became acceptable for doctors to dissect bodies to discover the cause of death.[229] The German professor Wilhelm Fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct. The Dutch professor Francois de la Boe Sylvius, a follower of Descartes, believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes and that acidic lymph fluid was the cause of cancer. His contemporary Nicolaes Tulp believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads and concluded that it was contagious.[230]
The physician John Hill described tobacco sniffing as the cause of nose cancer in 1761.[229] This was followed by the report in 1775 by British surgeon Percivall Pott that chimney sweeps' carcinoma, a cancer of the scrotum, was a common disease among chimney sweeps.[231] With the widespread use of the microscope in the 18th century, it was discovered that the 'cancer poison' spread from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites ("metastasis"). This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan between 1871 and 1874.[232]
Although many diseases (such as heart failure) may have a worse prognosis than most cases of cancer, cancer is the subject of widespread fear and taboos. The euphemism of "a long illness" to describe cancers leading to death is still commonly used in obituaries, rather than naming the disease explicitly, reflecting an apparent stigma.[233] Cancer is also euphemised as "the C-word";[234][235][236] Macmillan Cancer Support uses the term to try to lessen the fear around the disease.[237] In Nigeria, one local name for cancer translates into English as "the disease that cannot be cured".[238] This deep belief that cancer is necessarily a difficult and usually deadly disease is reflected in the systems chosen by society to compile cancer statistics: the most common form of cancer—non-melanoma skin cancers, accounting for about one-third of cancer cases worldwide, but very few deaths[239][240]—are excluded from cancer statistics specifically because they are easily treated and almost always cured, often in a single, short, outpatient procedure.[241]
Western conceptions of patients' rights for people with cancer include a duty to fully disclose the medical situation to the person, and the right to engage in shared decision-making in a way that respects the person's own values. In other cultures, other rights and values are preferred. For example, most African cultures value whole families rather than individualism. In parts of Africa, a diagnosis is commonly made so late that cure is not possible, and treatment, if available at all, would quickly bankrupt the family. As a result of these factors, African healthcare providers tend to let family members decide whether, when and how to disclose the diagnosis, and they tend to do so slowly and circuitously, as the person shows interest and an ability to cope with the grim news.[238] People from Asian and South American countries also tend to prefer a slower, less candid approach to disclosure than is idealized in the United States and Western Europe, and they believe that sometimes it would be preferable not to be told about a cancer diagnosis.[238] In general, disclosure of the diagnosis is more common than it was in the 20th century, but full disclosure of the prognosis is not offered to many patients around the world.[238]
In the United States and some other cultures, cancer is regarded as a disease that must be "fought" to end the "civil insurrection"; a War on Cancer was declared in the US. Military metaphors are particularly common in descriptions of cancer's human effects, and they emphasize both the state of the patient's health and the need to take immediate, decisive actions himself rather than to delay, to ignore or to rely entirely on others. The military metaphors also help rationalize radical, destructive treatments.[242][243]
In the 1970s, a relatively popular alternative cancer treatment in the US was a specialized form of talk therapy, based on the idea that cancer was caused by a bad attitude.[244] People with a "cancer personality"—depressed, repressed, self-loathing and afraid to express their emotions—were believed to have manifested cancer through subconscious desire. Some psychotherapists claimed that treatment to change the patient's outlook on life would cure the cancer.[244] Among other effects, this belief allowed society to blame the victim for having caused the cancer (by "wanting" it) or having prevented its cure (by not becoming a sufficiently happy, fearless and loving person).[245] It also increased patients' anxiety, as they incorrectly believed that natural emotions of sadness, anger or fear shorten their lives.[245] The idea was ridiculed by Susan Sontag, who published Illness as Metaphor while recovering from treatment for breast cancer in 1978.[244] Although the original idea is now generally regarded as nonsense, the idea partly persists in a reduced form with a widespread, but incorrect, belief that deliberately cultivating a habit of positive thinking will increase survival.[245] This notion is particularly strong in breast cancer culture.[245]
One idea about why people with cancer are blamed or stigmatized, called the just-world fallacy, is that blaming cancer on the patient's actions or attitudes allows the blamers to regain a sense of control. This is based upon the blamers' belief that the world is fundamentally just and so any dangerous illness, like cancer, must be a type of punishment for bad choices, because in a just world, bad things would not happen to good people.[246]
The total health care expenditure on cancer in the US was estimated to be $80.2 billion in 2015.[247] Even though cancer-related health care expenditure have increased in absolute terms during recent decades, the share of health expenditure devoted to cancer treatment has remained close to 5% between the 1960s and 2004.[248][249] A similar pattern has been observed in Europe where about 6% of all health care expenditure are spent on cancer treatment.[250][251] In addition to health care expenditure and financial toxicity, cancer causes indirect costs in the form of productivity losses due to sick days, permanent incapacity and disability as well as premature death during working age. Cancer causes also costs for informal care. Indirect costs and informal care costs are typically estimated to exceed or equal the health care costs of cancer.[252][251]
In the United States, cancer is included as a protected condition by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), mainly due to the potential for cancer having discriminating effects on workers.[253] Discrimination in the workplace could occur if an employer holds a false belief that a person with cancer is not capable of doing a job properly, and may ask for more sick leave than other employees. Employers may also make hiring or firing decisions based on misconceptions about cancer disabilities, if present. The EEOC provides interview guidelines for employers, as well as lists of possible solutions for assessing and accommodating employees with cancer.[253]
A study found women were around six times more likely to be divorced soon after a diagnosis of cancer compared to men.[254] Rate of separation for cancer-survivors showed correlations with race, age, income, and comorbidities in a study.[255] A review found a somewhat decreased divorce rate for most cancer types, and noted study heterogeneity and methodological weaknesses for many studies on the effects of cancer on divorce.[256]
Because cancer is a class of diseases,[7][257] it is unlikely that there will ever be a single "cure for cancer" any more than there will be a single treatment for all infectious diseases.[258] Angiogenesis inhibitors were once incorrectly thought to have potential as a "silver bullet" treatment applicable to many types of cancer.[259] Angiogenesis inhibitors and other cancer therapeutics are used in combination to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality.[260]
Experimental cancer treatments are studied in clinical trials to compare the proposed treatment to the best existing treatment. Treatments that succeeded in one cancer type can be tested against other types.[261] Diagnostic tests are under development to better target the right therapies to the right patients, based on their individual biology.[262]
Cancer research focuses on the following issues:
The improved understanding of molecular biology and cellular biology due to cancer research has led to new treatments for cancer since US President Richard Nixon declared the "War on Cancer" in 1971. Since then, the country has spent over $200 billion on cancer research, including resources from public and private sectors.[263] The cancer death rate (adjusting for size and age of the population) declined by five percent between 1950 and 2005.[264]
Competition for financial resources appears to have suppressed the creativity, cooperation, risk-taking and original thinking required to make fundamental discoveries, unduly favoring low-risk research into small incremental advancements over riskier, more innovative research. Other consequences of competition appear to be many studies with dramatic claims whose results cannot be replicated and perverse incentives that encourage grantee institutions to grow without making sufficient investments in their own faculty and facilities.[265][264][266][267]
Virotherapy, which uses convert viruses, is being studied.[citation needed]
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a worry that cancer research and treatment are slowing down.[268][269]
On 2 December 2023, Nano Today published a groundbreaking discovery involving "NK cell-engaging nanodrones" for targeted cancer treatment. The development of "NK cell-engaging nanodrones" represents a significant leap forward in cancer treatment, showcasing how cutting-edge nanotechnology and immunotherapy can be combined to target and eliminate cancer cells with unprecedented precision. These nanodrones are designed to harness the power of natural killer (NK) cells, which play a crucial role in the body's immune response against tumors. By directing these NK cells specifically to the sites of tumors, the nanodrones can effectively concentrate the immune system's attack on the cancer cells, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients.[270]
The key innovation here lies in the use of protein cage nanoparticle-based systems. These systems are engineered to carry signals that attract NK cells directly to the tumor, overcoming one of the major challenges in cancer immunotherapy: ensuring that the immune cells find and attack only the cancer cells without harming healthy tissue. This targeted approach not only increases the efficacy of the treatment but also minimizes side effects, a common concern with broader-acting cancer therapies.[270]
Cancer affects approximately 1 in 1,000 pregnant women. The most common cancers found during pregnancy are the same as the most common cancers found in non-pregnant women during childbearing ages: breast cancer, cervical cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer.[271]
Diagnosing a new cancer in a pregnant woman is difficult, in part because any symptoms are commonly assumed to be a normal discomfort associated with pregnancy. As a result, cancer is typically discovered at a somewhat later stage than average. Some imaging procedures, such as MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging), CT scans, ultrasounds and mammograms with fetal shielding are considered safe during pregnancy; some others, such as PET scans, are not.[271]
Treatment is generally the same as for non-pregnant women. However, radiation and radioactive drugs are normally avoided during pregnancy, especially if the fetal dose might exceed 100 cGy. In some cases, some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy. Early deliveries are often used to advance the start of treatment. Surgery is generally safe, but pelvic surgeries during the first trimester may cause miscarriage. Some treatments, especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the first trimester, increase the risk of birth defects and pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortions and stillbirths).[271]
Elective abortions are not required and, for the most common forms and stages of cancer, do not improve the mother's survival. In a few instances, such as advanced uterine cancer, the pregnancy cannot be continued and in others, the patient may end the pregnancy so that she can begin aggressive chemotherapy.[271]
Some treatments can interfere with the mother's ability to give birth vaginally or to breastfeed.[271] Cervical cancer may require birth by Caesarean section. Radiation to the breast reduces the ability of that breast to produce milk and increases the risk of mastitis. Also, when chemotherapy is given after birth, many of the drugs appear in breast milk, which could harm the baby.[271]
Veterinary oncology, concentrating mainly on cats and dogs, is a growing specialty in wealthy countries and the major forms of human treatment such as surgery and radiotherapy may be offered. The most common types of cancer differ, but the cancer burden seems at least as high in pets as in humans. Animals, typically rodents, are often used in cancer research and studies of natural cancers in larger animals may benefit research into human cancer.[272]
Across wild animals, there is still limited data on cancer. Nonetheless, a study published in 2022, explored cancer risk in (non-domesticated) zoo mammals, belonging to 191 species, 110,148 individual, demonstrated that cancer is a ubiquitous disease of mammals and it can emerge anywhere along the mammalian phylogeny.[273] This research also highlighted that cancer risk is not uniformly distributed along mammals. For instance, species in the order Carnivora are particularly prone to be affected by cancer (e.g. over 25% of clouded leopards, bat-eared foxes and red wolves die of cancer), while ungulates (especially even-toed ungulates) appear to face consistently low cancer risks.[citation needed]
In non-humans, a few types of transmissible cancer have also been described, wherein the cancer spreads between animals by transmission of the tumor cells themselves. This phenomenon is seen in dogs with Sticker's sarcoma (also known as canine transmissible venereal tumor), and in Tasmanian devils with devil facial tumour disease (DFTD).[274]

- Carcinoma: Cancers derived from epithelial cells. This group includes many of the most common cancers and include nearly all those in the breast, prostate, lung, pancreas and colon. Most of these are of the adenocarcinoma type, which means that the cancer has gland-like differentiation.
- Sarcoma: Cancers arising from connective tissue (i.e. bone, cartilage, fat, nerve), each of which develops from cells originating in mesenchymal cells outside the bone marrow.

- Whether early detection improves treatment outcomes
- Whether cancer will ever need treatment
- Whether the test is acceptable to the people: If a screening test is too burdensome (for example, extremely painful), then people will refuse to participate.[166]
- Strongly recommends cervical cancer screening in women who are sexually active and have a cervix at least until the age of 65.[167]
- Recommend that Americans be screened for colorectal cancer via fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy starting at age 50 until age 75.[168]
- Evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening for skin cancer,[169] oral cancer,[170] lung cancer,[171] or prostate cancer in men under 75.[172]
- Routine screening is not recommended for bladder cancer,[173] testicular cancer,[174] ovarian cancer,[175] pancreatic cancer,[176] or prostate cancer.[177]
- Recommends mammography for breast cancer screening every two years from ages 50–74, but does not recommend either breast self-examination or clinical breast examination.[178] A 2013 Cochrane review concluded that breast cancer screening by mammography had no effect in reducing mortality because of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.[179]

Archived from the original on 2 January 2016. A certain irreducible background incidence of cancer is to be expected regardless of circumstances: mutations can never be absolutely avoided, because they are an inescapable consequence of fundamental limitations on the accuracy of DNA replication, as discussed in Chapter 5. If a human could live long enough, it is inevitable that at least one of his or her cells would eventually accumulate a set of mutations sufficient for cancer to develop.

==================================================
Cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body. Other terms used are malignant tumours and neoplasms. One defining
feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, and which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs; the latter process is referred to as metastasis. Widespread metastases
are the primary cause of death from cancer.
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 (1). The most common in 2020 (in terms of new cases of cancer) were:
The most common causes of cancer death in 2020 were:
Each year, approximately 400 000 children develop cancer. The most common cancers vary between countries. Cervical cancer is the most common in 23 countries.
Cancer arises from the transformation of normal cells into tumour cells in a multi-stage process that generally progresses from a pre-cancerous lesion to a malignant tumour. These changes are the result of the interaction between a person's genetic factors
and three categories of external agents, including:
WHO, through its cancer research agency, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), maintains a classification of cancer-causing agents.
The incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age, most likely due to a build-up of risks for specific cancers that increase with age. The overall risk accumulation is combined with the tendency for cellular repair mechanisms to be less effective as
a person grows older.
Tobacco use, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and air pollution are risk factors for cancer and other noncommunicable diseases.
Some chronic infections are risk factors for cancer; this is a particular issue in low- and middle-income countries. Approximately 13% of cancers diagnosed in 2018 globally were attributed to carcinogenic infections, including Helicobacter pylori, human
papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (2).
Hepatitis B and C viruses and some types of HPV increase the risk for liver and cervical cancer, respectively. Infection with HIV increases the risk of developing cervical cancer six-fold and substantially increases the risk of developing select other
cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma.
Between 30 and 50% of cancers can currently be prevented by avoiding risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies. The cancer burden can also be reduced through early detection of cancer and appropriate treatment and care
of patients who develop cancer. Many cancers have a high chance of cure if diagnosed early and treated appropriately.
Cancer risk can be reduced by:
Cancer mortality is reduced when cases are detected and treated early. There are two components of early detection: early diagnosis and screening.
When identified early, cancer is more likely to respond to treatment and can result in a greater probability of survival with less morbidity, as well as less expensive treatment. Significant improvements can be made in the lives of cancer patients by
detecting cancer early and avoiding delays in care.
Early diagnosis consists of three components:
Early diagnosis of symptomatic cancers is relevant in all settings and the majority of cancers. Cancer programmes should be designed to reduce delays in, and barriers to, diagnosis, treatment and supportive care.
Screening aims to identify individuals with findings suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer before they have developed symptoms. When abnormalities are identified during screening, further tests to establish a definitive diagnosis should follow,
as should referral for treatment if cancer is proven to be present.
Screening programmes are effective for some but not all cancer types and in general are far more complex and resource-intensive than early diagnosis as they require special equipment and dedicated personnel. Even when screening programmes are established,
early diagnosis programmes are still necessary to identify those cancer cases occurring in people who do not meet the age or risk factor criteria for screening.
Patient selection for screening programmes is based on age and risk factors to avoid excessive false positive studies. Examples of screening methods are:
Quality assurance is required for both screening and early diagnosis programmes.
A correct cancer diagnosis is essential for appropriate and effective treatment because every cancer type requires a specific treatment regimen. Treatment usually includes surgery, radiotherapy, and/or systemic therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal treatments,
targeted biological therapies). Proper selection of a treatment regimen takes into consideration both the cancer and the individual being treated. Completion of the treatment protocol in a defined period of time is important to achieve the predicted
therapeutic result.
Determining the goals of treatment is an important first step. The primary goal is generally to cure cancer or to considerably prolong life. Improving the patient's quality of life is also an important goal. This can be achieved by support for the patient’s
physical, psychosocial and spiritual well-being and palliative care in terminal stages of cancer.
Some of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer, and colorectal cancer, have high cure probabilities when detected early and treated according to best practices.
Some cancer types, such as testicular seminoma and different types of leukaemia and lymphoma in children, also have high cure rates if appropriate treatment is provided, even when cancerous cells are present in other areas of the body.
There is, however, a significant variation in treatment availability between countries of different income levels; comprehensive treatment is reportedly available in more than 90% of high-income countries but less than 15% of low-income countries (3).
Palliative care is treatment to relieve, rather than cure, symptoms and suffering caused by cancer and to improve the quality of life of patients and their families. Palliative care can help people live more comfortably. It is particularly needed
in places with a high proportion of patients in advanced stages of cancer where there is little chance of cure.
Relief from physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems through palliative care is possible for more than 90% of patients with advanced stages of cancer.
Effective public health strategies, comprising community- and home-based care, are essential to provide pain relief and palliative care for patients and their families.
In 2017, the World Health Assembly passed the Resolution Cancer prevention and control in the context of an integrated approach (WHA70.12) that urges
governments and WHO to accelerate action to achieve the targets specified in the Global Action Plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013-2020 and the 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development to reduce premature mortality from cancer.

India witnesses approximately 1,200,000 new cancer cases each year. According to the latest data from the National Cancer Registry, 1 in 8 men and 1 in 9 women in India are projected to develop some form of cancer during their lifetime.
The incidence and types of cancer that are diagnosed are influenced by a multitude of factors, including age, gender, ethnicity, local environmental conditions, dietary habits, and genetic predisposition. Among males in India, lung cancer holds the highest incidence, followed by oral cavity and throat cancers. Among females, cervical cancer and breast cancer are the most commonly diagnosed forms.
Cancer is a condition characterised by the abnormal behaviour of certain cells within the body. In a healthy person, cells follow a specific pattern of growth, division, and eventually, natural death, which is essential to maintain proper bodily function. However, in the case of cancer, these cells deviate from this normal behaviour, undergoing uncontrollable and abnormal growth.
Difference Between Cancer Cells and Normal Cells
Tissue Changes that are ‘Not’ Cancer
Not all changes in body tissues are indicative of cancer. However, certain changes should be monitored as they have the potential to develop into cancer if left untreated. Let's explore some examples of tissue changes that are not cancerous but may warrant attention due to their potential to progress:
Hyperplasia: Hyperplasia occurs when cells within a tissue multiply at a faster rate than normal, leading to an accumulation of extra cells. However, when examined under a microscope, the cells and tissue's structure will still appear normal.
Dysplasia: Dysplasia is a more advanced condition compared to hyperplasia. There is also an accumulation of extra cells, but these cells appear abnormal, and there are changes in the way the tissue is organised. In general, the more abnormal the cells and tissues appear, the higher the likelihood of cancer development.
Carcinoma in Situ: Carcinoma in situ is an even more advanced condition. While sometimes referred to as “stage 0 cancers,” it's important to note that it's not technically cancer because the abnormal cells do not invade nearby tissues to the same extent as cancer cells do. However, since some carcinomas can progress to become invasive cancers, they are typically treated.
Cancers are named after the organs or tissues in which they originate. The specific type of cell that gives rise to cancer, such as epithelial or squamous cells, is also used in the classification.
1. Carcinoma: The Most Common Type
Carcinoma is the most prevalent type of cancer. It primarily consists of epithelial cells that line both the inner and outer surfaces of the body. A variant known as basal cell carcinoma is also noteworthy.
2. Sarcoma: Affecting Bone and Soft Tissues
Sarcomas are cancers that develop in bone and soft tissues, encompassing muscle, fat, blood vessels, lymphatics, as well as fibrous tissues like tendons and ligaments.
3. Leukaemia: Blood-Related Cancer
Leukaemia is a form of cancer that originates in the blood-forming tissues of the bone marrow. Unlike other cancers, leukaemia does not form solid tumours. Instead, it results in the accumulation of abnormal white blood cells (leukaemia cells and leukemic blast cells) in the blood and bone marrow, displacing normal blood cells.

4. Lymphoma: Involving Lymphocytes
Lymphoma is characterised by the malignancy of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell crucial for the immune system. In this type of cancer, abnormal cells accumulate in the body's lymph nodes, lymphatic vessels, and other organs.
5. Multiple Myeloma: Affecting Plasma Cells
Multiple myeloma originates in plasma cells, another type of immune cell. The abnormal plasma cells, referred to as myeloma cells, accumulate in the bone marrow, forming tumours throughout the skeletal system.
6. Melanoma: Skin and Beyond
Melanoma is a cancer that begins in specialised melanocytes, cells responsible for producing melanin. While most melanomas develop in the skin, they can also occur in other pigmented tissues, including the eye.

7. Brain and Spinal Cord Tumours: Diverse Forms
Tumours originating in the brain and spinal cord manifest in various forms. They are classified based on the cell type of origin and the location within the central nervous system where they first appear.

Cancer can present with a variety of signs and symptoms, which may vary depending on the specific area of the body that is affected. To help better recognize potential warning signs, here is a list of common indicators that are not exclusive to cancer but should prompt you to seek medical attention:
If someone experiences any of these symptoms, it's essential for them to consult their doctor promptly. The doctor will ask questions, perform physical examinations, and may recommend further diagnostic tests. If cancer is suspected, the patient may be referred to one of the best oncologists in India for specialised evaluation and treatment.

Common Causes of Cancer
The primary cause of cancer is mutations, or alterations in the DNA within an individual's cells. These genetic mutations may either be inherited or acquired after birth due to exposure to certain substances and environmental factors.
Carcinogens, which are substances known to increase the risk of cancer, can be categorised into three main groups:
Risk Factors of Cancer
The risk of developing cancer is influenced by various factors, and understanding these risk factors is crucial. Some common risk factors that can increase the likelihood of developing cancer include:

Various methods and techniques are employed to identify the presence of cancer cells and tumours in the human body. When seeking the best cancer hospital in India for diagnosis and treatment, it's essential to consider the hospital's expertise in utilising these methods.
A biopsy is a medical procedure where a sample of tissue is collected from the suspicious area and examined under a microscope. Pathologists analyse the tissue sample to check for the presence of cancer cells, helping to confirm the diagnosis.
Histopathological Studies of Tissue
Histopathological studies involve the microscopic analysis of tissue samples. Pathologists study these samples to detect abnormal cellular changes that are indicative of cancer. This technique is crucial for understanding the characteristics of cancerous tissues.
Radiography Techniques
Radiography techniques, such as X-rays, are often used to capture images of affected areas in the body. These images help in the identification of abnormalities, including tumours or irregular masses that might be indicative of cancer.
Computed Tomography (CT)
Computed Tomography, commonly known as CT or CAT scans, provides detailed cross-sectional images of the body. It aids in the detection and localization of cancerous growths. CT scans are particularly valuable for visualising solid organs and bones.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
MRI is another imaging technique that provides high-resolution images for the assessment of cancer, especially in soft tissues. It offers excellent contrast and is highly effective in identifying abnormalities in various parts of the body.
Molecular Biology Techniques
Advanced molecular biology techniques have revolutionised cancer detection. These methods involve the analysis of genetic and molecular markers to identify cancer-related mutations and abnormalities. By studying the DNA and RNA of cells, scientists can pinpoint specific genetic changes associated with different types of cancer.
Cancer staging systems play a pivotal role in guiding healthcare providers as they chart a course of treatment and offer patients a prognosis, or an anticipated outcome. Among the various staging systems, the TNM classification is the most widely employed. It simplifies the complex reality of cancer progression into three key factors:
Most cancer types are categorised into four primary stages. The specific stage assigned to a patient depends on several factors, including the tumour's size and its location within the body:
In addition to these four primary stages, there's also Stage 0, which characterises the earliest phase of cancer. In Stage 0, the cancer is restricted to the site where it originated, making it highly treatable. Many practitioners categorise Stage 0 cancers as precancerous, indicating their potential to progress if not addressed.
Cancer treatment is a collaborative effort that involves various approaches, each tailored to address specific aspects of the disease. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the primary methods of cancer treatment, their objectives, and how they contribute to the well-being of cancer patients.
The primary objective of cancer treatment is to completely eradicate cancer from the body or destroy all cancer cells. While various treatment options can serve as primary treatments, the most common approach for the most prevalent types of cancer is surgery.
Adjuvant therapy focuses on eliminating any residual cancer cells after primary treatment to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence.
Palliative care treatments are designed to alleviate side effects resulting from treatment or symptoms caused by cancer itself. They encompass a range of interventions, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy procedure, and hormone therapy, which can provide relief from pain and discomfort.
The primary goal of surgery is the complete removal of malignant tissue, whenever possible.
Chemotherapy employs drugs to target and eliminate cancer cells.
Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays, such as X-rays or protons, to obliterate cancer cells.
Bone Marrow Transplant
A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, involves using either the patient's own bone marrow stem cells or those from a donor to restore healthy blood cell production.
Immunotherapy Procedure
Immunotherapy, a biological treatment, leverages the body's immune system to combat cancer. It addresses the challenge where the immune system fails to recognize cancer as a threat, allowing it to proliferate unchecked.
Certain cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer, are influenced by hormones. Hormone therapy works by removing these hormones from the body or blocking their effects, thereby halting the growth of cancer cells.
Targeted drug therapy focuses on specific abnormalities within cancer cells to inhibit their growth.
Cryoablation is a treatment that uses cold temperatures to destroy cancer cells. A cryoprobe, a thin needle, is inserted directly into the cancerous tumour. It's filled with gas to freeze the tissue, which is then thawed and repeated multiple times in the same session to effectively eliminate cancer cells.
Radiofrequency Ablation
Radiofrequency ablation uses electrical energy to heat and destroy cancer cells. A doctor inserts a thin needle through the skin or an incision in the cancerous tissue, and radiofrequency energy is applied to the needle to heat the tissue, causing the cells to die.

Specialist in Location
- Germ Cell Tumours: These tumours initiate in the cells responsible for sperm or ovum production and can appear in various body locations, potentially being benign or malignant.
- Neuroendocrine Tumours: These tumours arise from cells that secrete hormones into the bloodstream in response to nervous system signals. They may lead to a wide range of symptoms due to the excessive hormone production.
- Carcinoid Tumours: Carcinoid tumours, a subset of neuroendocrine tumours, typically grow slowly and are commonly found in the gastrointestinal system. In some cases, they can metastasize to the liver or other body parts.
- Changes in Bowel or Bladder Habits: Look out for unexplained changes like persistent diarrhoea or constipation, frequent urgency when urinating, or any other unusual bowel or bladder irregularities.
- Non-Healing Sores: It's important to pay attention to any sore on the body that doesn't seem to heal as expected.
- Unusual Bleeding or Discharge: Any unexplained bleeding or discharge, such as blood in urine, stool, between menstrual periods, vomit, or cough, should be investigated.
- Thickening or Lump: If you notice any unexplained lump or thickening in any part of the body, you should consult a medical professional promptly.
- Wart or Mole Changes: Any noticeable changes in the size, shape, or colour of warts or moles should be examined by a doctor.
- Nagging Cough, Breathlessness, or Hoarseness: Medical advice should be sought if one has a cough or experiences breathlessness for more than two weeks, or if you notice blood in the phlegm.
- Fatigue or Unexplained Swelling: Keep an eye out for fatigue that doesn't improve with rest, or areas of swelling that can be felt under the skin.
- Weight Fluctuations: Significant unintentional weight loss or gain should be investigated.
- Skin Changes: Changes in the skin, including yellowing, darkening, redness, non-healing wounds, or alterations in existing birthmarks, require medical attention.
- Persistent Indigestion After Eating: If one experiences ongoing discomfort or indigestion after eating, they should consult a healthcare professional.
- Unexplained Persistent Fever or Night Sweats: Prolonged, unexplained fever or night sweats should not be ignored.
- Unexplained Persistent Muscle or Joint Pain: One should seek medical evaluation for persistent, unexplained muscle or joint pain.
- Physical Carcinogens: These encompass exposure to radiation and ultraviolet (UV) light, like that from the sun, which can be harmful to the skin.
- Chemical Carcinogens: Examples include cigarette smoke, asbestos, alcohol, air pollution, and certain chemicals found in contaminated food and drinking water. These are substances that, when encountered, can potentially lead to cancer.
- Biological Carcinogens: This category involves viruses, bacteria, and parasites that are linked to an increased risk of cancer development.
- Tobacco Use: Smoking and the use of tobacco products significantly elevate the risk of various types of cancer.
- High Alcohol Consumption: Excessive alcohol intake is associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, including those of the mouth, throat, and liver.
- Lack of Physical Activity: A sedentary lifestyle can be a risk factor, as regular physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of certain cancers.
- Exposure to Air Pollution: Prolonged exposure to polluted air, especially in urban areas, may contribute to cancer risk, particularly lung cancer.
- Exposure to Radiation: Occupational or medical exposure to radiation, such as X-rays and certain treatments, can increase the risk of cancer.
- Unprotected Exposure to UV Light: Excessive and unprotected exposure to UV light, like sunlight and tanning beds, is linked to skin cancer.
- Abnormal Cell Division: Normal cells grow, divide, and replace damaged ones according to their life cycle. Cancer, caused by DNA mutations, disturbs this process. Mutations allow cells to survive when they should die and create unnecessary new cells, resulting in uncontrollable growth and tumour formation.
- Creation of Tumours: Tumours can pose health problems, but not all are cancerous. Benign tumours remain localised, while malignant tumours invade neighbouring tissues, potentially causing more severe issues.
- Metastasis: Metastasis involves cancer cells spreading through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Metastatic cancers are more advanced and challenging to treat, often associated with higher fatality rates.
- T represents the primary tumour.
- N indicates lymph nodes and signals whether the cancer has extended to these vital components of the immune system.
- M is for metastasis, indicating the spread of cancer to distant parts of the body.
- Stage I: At this stage, cancer is confined to a small, localised area, without any evidence of spreading to nearby lymph nodes or other tissues.
- Stage II: Cancer has experienced some growth, but it still remains localised and hasn't extended to other areas of the body.
- Stage III: Cancer has grown larger, possibly involving nearby lymph nodes or adjacent tissues.
- Stage IV: This advanced stage indicates that cancer has spread to other organs or distant areas of the body, a condition often termed metastatic cancer.

URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy
==================================================
Malignancy (from Latin  male 'badly' and  -gnus 'born') is the tendency of a medical condition to become progressively worse; the term is most familiar as a characterization of cancer.
A malignant tumor contrasts with a non-cancerous benign tumor in that a malignancy is not self-limited in its growth, is capable of invading into adjacent tissues, and may be capable of spreading to distant tissues.
A benign tumor has none of those properties, but may still be harmful to health. The term benign in more general medical use characterizes a condition or growth that is not cancerous, i.e. does not spread to other parts of the body or invade nearby tissue. Sometimes the term is used to suggest that a condition is not dangerous or serious.[4]
Malignancy in cancers is characterized by anaplasia, invasiveness, and metastasis.[5] Malignant tumors are also characterized by genome instability, so that cancers, as assessed by whole genome sequencing, frequently have between 10,000 and 100,000 mutations in their entire genomes.[6]  Cancers usually show tumour heterogeneity, containing multiple subclones.[7] They also frequently have reduced expression of DNA repair enzymes due to epigenetic methylation of DNA repair genes or altered microRNAs that control DNA repair gene expression.
Tumours can be detected through the visualisation or sensation of a lump on the body.[8] In cases where there is no obvious representation of a lump, a mammogram or an MRI test can be used to determine the presence of a tumour.[8] In the case of an existing tumour, a biopsy would then be required to make a diagnosis and distinguish whether the tumour is malignant or benign.[8] This involves examination of a small sample of the tissue in a laboratory.[8] If detected as a malignant tumour, treatment is necessary; treatment during early stages is most effective.[8] Forms of treatment include chemotherapy, surgery, photoradiation, and hyperthermia, amongst various others.
When malignant cells form, symptoms do not typically appear until there has been a significant growth of the mass. Once signs and symptoms do arise, they are dependent on the location, size and type of malignancy. Usually, it is quite general and can be associated with other illnesses or diseases and thus, can be difficult to diagnose or can be misdiagnosed.
Signs include observable or measurable aspects such as weight loss (without trying), a fever or unusual bleeding.[9] On the other hand, symptoms are felt internally by the individual such as fatigue or changes in appetite.[9] A general list of common signs and symptoms includes pain (headaches or bone aches), skin changes (new moles or bumps), coughing and unusual bleeding.[1] There are also signs and symptoms specific to females including belly pain and bloating or breast changes i.e., the formation of a lump.[1] Signs and symptoms specific to males include pain or growths in the scrotum or difficulty urinating.[1]
Malignant cells often evolve due to a combination of reasons rather than one definitive reason. Reasons which can explain their development include genetics and family history, triggers such as infectious diseases, and exposure to risk factors.
Infectious diseases play a role in the development of malignancy, with agents of infectious disease being able to produce a multitude of malignant cells.[10] These include bacterial causes, fungal and parasitic causes and, viral causes.[10] Bacteria, fungi and similar pathogens have the ability to form an environment within states of chronic inflammation which gives rise to oncogenic potential.[10] Viral agents are able to assist the formation of malignant tumours due to a mechanism of cell transformation.[10] This cell transformation can occur through either "DNA integration or cellular-DNA alteration of growth regulator genes".[10] Inflammation can also play a role in triggering malignancy as it can promote stages of tumour formation.[11] The main purpose of inflammation is to repair tissue, defend the body against pathogens and regenerate cells.[11] At the same time, inflammatory cells can also interact with malignant cells to form an inflammatory tumour microenvironment.[11] This environment increases the likelihood of forming malignant cells through blockage of anti-tumour immunity.[11] Once this occurs, the inflammatory tumour microenvironment begins to send out tumour-promoting signals to epithelial cells, triggering the formation of malignant cells.[11]
Traditional risk factors of developing malignancy include smoking, sun exposure and, having a history of cancer in the family. Other risk factors include developing post-transplant malignancy which occurs subsequent to solid organ transplantations.[12]
Post-transplant malignancy
Individuals who undergo organ transplant surgery have an increased risk of developing malignancy in comparison to the general population.[12] The most common form of malignancy being "nonmelanoma skin cancer and, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders".[12] The different types of malignancy developed post-transplant depend on which organ was transplanted.[13] This is linked to recipients being at a higher risk when exposed to traditional risk factors as well as, the type and intensity of the operation, the duration of their immunosuppression post-operation and, the risk of developing oncogenic viral infections.[12]
There are various treatment forms available to help manage malignancy. Common treatments include chemotherapy, radiation and surgical procedures. Photoradiation and hyperthermia are also used as treatment forms to kill or reduce malignant cells. A large portion of patients are at risk of death when diagnosed with malignancy as the disease has usually progressed for a number of years before detection.[14]
Surgery can help manage or treat malignancy by either removing the tumour, localising it and/or determining whether there has been a spread to other organs.[15][16] When undertaking surgery for malignancy, there are six major objectives which are considered.[14] These include "prevention of cancer, diagnosis and staging of disease, disease cure, tumour debulking, symptom palliation and patient rehabilitation".[14]
Surgical prevention of cancer largely consists of removing the organ at risk of developing malignancy.[14] This would occur if an individual is predisposed to the formation of malignant cells as a result of inherited genetic mutations and, acquired diseases.[14]
Surgical diagnosis of malignancy involves completing a biopsy.[14] This process requires a sufficient amount of tissue to make a confident diagnosis and, the handling of specimen to expand information provided from testing.[14] Biopsies are categorised into four different processes: "fine-needle aspirate (FNA), core needle, incisional and, excisional".[14]
Curative surgery (also known as primary surgery) can be conducted when the malignant tumour has only invaded one area of the body.[15][16] The objective is to remove the entirety of the malignant cells without violating the tumour; if the tumour is violated, the risk of both tumour spillage and wound implantation would increase.[15][16]
The surgical procedure of tumour debulking can be undertaken to increase the effectiveness of postoperative forms of treatment.[14] Symptom palliation and patient rehabilitation do not play a role in controlling or reducing malignancy growth rather, they increase the patient's quality of life.[14]
Hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) is a drug which was developed to be absorbed by malignant cells and only becomes active when exposed to light.[17] It is commonly used to identify and localise cancers as when it is under activation of blue light the red fluorescence of the malignant tumour (due to the HPD) can be observed easily.[18]
The combination of HPD with red light (photoradiation) has been used on various malignant tumours including malignant melanomas and carcinomas on a range of different organs including the breast and colon.[18] This form of treatment produces a singlet oxygen through the photodynamic process;[18] where the oxygen molecule exists in an electronically excited state.[19] The singlet oxygen is a cytotoxic agent [18] which holds the ability to eradicate malignant cells by preventing both nucleic acid and protein synthesis.[20] The treatment process also utilises HPD's capability of accumulating at higher levels in malignant tissues compared to most other tissues.[18]
In the case of deeply pigmented or larger tumours, a stronger course of this treatment process is required in order to be effective.[18]
Malignancy can be treated through the use of hyperthermia by applying either surgical perfusion or interstitial techniques to the body.[21] The use of this treatment type largely depends on the fact that malignant and normal cells have differing responses to the energy source used.[21] This dependency is due to the intracellular changes which occur during hyperthermia; as the nucleic acids, cell membrane and cytoskeleton within each cell is affected indirectly and/or through multiple pathways.[21] The combination of these intracellular changes means there is no specific target of cell death in the hyperthermic process.[21]
Chemotherapy is commonly used as either the primary treatment or in conjunction with other treatment forms such as radiotherapy or surgery.[22] It can be administered through "injection, intra-arterial (IA), intraperitoneal (IP), intrathecal (IT), intravenous (IV), topical or oral".[22]
The purpose of chemotherapy is to use cytotoxic agents which kill rapidly dividing cells within the body.[23] It targets the cellular mechanisms which allow the development of malignancy throughout the body.[24] There are no specific areas which are targeted and so, there is a lack of differentiation between normal and malignant cells,[24] resulting in a range of side effects. This includes bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal problems and alopecia.[23] Some side effects are specific to the anticancer drug used, the most common being bone marrow suppression as bone marrow has the ability to divide rapidly due to high growth fraction.[23] This is because anticancer drugs have the highest activity in high growth fraction tissues.[23]
Alkylating agents are used in chemotherapy as these are chemically reactive drugs which form covalent bonds when reacting with DNA.[24] This results in breaks within DNA strands causing either inter-strand or intra-strand DNA cross-linking.[24] The sub-classes of alkylating agents are "nitrogen mustards, oxazaphosphorines, alkyl alkane, sulphonates, nitrosoureas, tetrazines and aziridines."[24]
Malignancy has been a constant global health concern for a number of years, resulting in significant social and economic impacts on individuals with malignancy and their families.[25] The risk of developing malignancy is 20.2%.[26] In 2018, 18 million patients were diagnosed with a malignant tumour with lung, breast and prostate being the most common form.[26] Additionally, there were approximately 10 million mortalities due to cancer in 2020[3] and, there is an overall trend which demonstrated that malignant mortality has increased by 28% over the past 15 years.[26]
Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate in comparison to other forms of cancer, with the leading cause of development due to smoking.[27] The number of smokers in China is rapidly increasing with tobacco killing approximately 3000 people each day.[27] The diagnosis of lung cancer is most common within the 50–59-year age bracket.[26] Further, it caused 1.8 million deaths in 2020 alone.[3]
In those aged 14 or younger, leukaemia is the most frequent form of malignancy with the brain and nervous system subsequent.[26] These individuals account for approximately 1% of the cancer mortality rate – about 110,000 children each year.[28] In the 15–49-year-old age bracket the most common form of malignancy is breast cancer with liver and lung cancer following.[26] Finally, those aged 60 and over mainly develop lung, colorectal, stomach and liver malignancy.[26]

URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm
==================================================
A neoplasm (/ˈniːoʊplæzəm, ˈniːə-/)[1][2] is a type of abnormal and excessive growth of tissue. The process that occurs to form or produce a neoplasm is called neoplasia. The growth of a neoplasm is uncoordinated with that of the normal surrounding tissue, and persists in growing abnormally, even if the original trigger is removed.[3][4][5] This abnormal growth usually forms a mass, which may be called a tumour or tumor.[6]
ICD-10 classifies neoplasms into four main groups: benign neoplasms, in situ neoplasms, malignant neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior.[7] Malignant neoplasms are also simply known as cancers and are the focus of oncology.
Prior to the abnormal growth of tissue, such as neoplasia, cells often undergo an abnormal pattern of growth, such as metaplasia or dysplasia.[8] However, metaplasia or dysplasia does not always progress to neoplasia and can occur in other conditions as well.[3] The word neoplasm is from Ancient Greek νέος- neo 'new' and πλάσμα plasma 'formation, creation'.
A neoplasm can be benign, potentially malignant, or malignant (cancer).[9]
Neoplastic tumors are often heterogeneous and contain more than one type of cell, but their initiation and continued growth are usually dependent on a single population of neoplastic cells. These cells are presumed to be monoclonal – that is, they are derived from the same cell,[10] and all carry the same genetic or epigenetic anomaly – evident of clonality. For lymphoid neoplasms, e.g. lymphoma and leukemia, clonality is proven by the amplification of a single rearrangement of their immunoglobulin gene (for B cell lesions) or T cell receptor gene (for T cell lesions). The demonstration of clonality is now considered to be necessary to identify a lymphoid cell proliferation as neoplastic.[11]
The word tumor or tumour comes from the Latin word for swelling, which is one of the cardinal signs of inflammation. The word originally referred to any form of swelling, neoplastic or not. In modern English, tumor (non-US spelling: tumour)  is used as a synonym for a neoplasm (a solid or fluid-filled cystic lesion that may or may not be formed by an abnormal growth of neoplastic cells) that appears enlarged in size.[12][13] Some neoplasms do not form a tumor; these include leukemia and most forms of carcinoma in situ. Tumor is also not synonymous with cancer. While cancer is by definition malignant, a tumor can be benign, precancerous, or malignant.[citation needed]
The terms mass and nodule are often used synonymously with tumor. Generally speaking, however, the term tumor is used generically, without reference to the physical size of the lesion.[3] More specifically, the term mass is often used when the lesion has a maximal diameter of at least 20 millimeters (mm) in the greatest direction, while the term nodule is usually used when the size of the lesion is less than 20 mm in its greatest dimension (25.4 mm = 1 inch).[3]
Tumors in humans occur as a result of accumulated genetic and epigenetic alterations within single cells, which cause the cell to divide and expand uncontrollably.[14] A neoplasm can be caused by an abnormal proliferation of tissues, which can be caused by genetic mutations. Not all types of neoplasms cause a tumorous overgrowth of tissue (such as leukemia or carcinoma in situ); however, similarities between neoplasmic growths and regenerative processes, e.g., dedifferentiation and rapid cell proliferation, have been pointed out.[15]
Tumor growth has been studied using mathematics and continuum mechanics. Vascular tumors such as hemangiomas and lymphangiomas (formed from blood or lymph vessels) are thus looked at as being amalgams of a solid skeleton formed by sticky cells and an organic liquid filling the spaces in which cells can grow.[16] Under this type of model, mechanical stresses and strains can be dealt with and their influence on the growth of the tumor and the surrounding tissue and vasculature elucidated. Recent findings from experiments that use this model show that active growth of the tumor is restricted to the outer edges of the tumor and that stiffening of the underlying normal tissue inhibits tumor growth as well.[17]
Benign conditions that are not associated with an abnormal proliferation of tissue (such as sebaceous cysts) can also present as tumors, however, but have no malignant potential. Breast cysts (as occur commonly during pregnancy and at other times) are another example, as are other encapsulated glandular swellings (thyroid, adrenal gland, pancreas).[citation needed]
Encapsulated hematomas, encapsulated necrotic tissue (from an insect bite, foreign body, or other noxious mechanism), keloids (discrete overgrowths of scar tissue) and granulomas may also present as tumors.[citation needed]
Discrete localized enlargements of normal structures (ureters, blood vessels, intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ducts, pulmonary inclusions, or gastrointestinal duplications) due to outflow obstructions or narrowings, or abnormal connections, may also present as a tumor. Examples are arteriovenous fistulae or aneurysms (with or without thrombosis), biliary fistulae or aneurysms, sclerosing cholangitis, cysticercosis or hydatid cysts, intestinal duplications, and pulmonary inclusions as seen with cystic fibrosis. It can be dangerous to biopsy a number of types of tumor in which the leakage of their contents would potentially be catastrophic. When such types of tumors are encountered, diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, angiograms, and nuclear medicine scans are employed prior to (or during) biopsy or surgical exploration/excision in an attempt to avoid such severe complications.[citation needed]
DNA damage is considered to be the primary underlying cause of malignant neoplasms known as cancers.[18] Its central role in progression to cancer is illustrated in the figure in this section, in the box near the top. (The central features of DNA damage, epigenetic alterations and deficient DNA repair in progression to cancer are shown in red.) DNA damage is very common. Naturally occurring DNA damages (mostly due to cellular metabolism and the properties of DNA in water at body temperatures) occur at a rate of more than 10,000 new damages, on average, per human cell, per day.[19] Additional DNA damages can arise from exposure to exogenous agents. Tobacco smoke causes increased exogenous DNA damage, and these DNA damages are the likely cause of lung cancer due to smoking.[20] UV light from solar radiation causes DNA damage that is important in melanoma.[21] Helicobacter pylori infection produces high levels of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA and contributes to gastric cancer.[22] Bile acids, at high levels in the colons of humans eating a high-fat diet, also cause DNA damage and contribute to colon cancer.[23] Katsurano et al. indicated that macrophages and neutrophils in an inflamed colonic epithelium are the source of reactive oxygen species causing the DNA damages that initiate colonic tumorigenesis (creation of tumors in the colon).[24][unreliable source?] Some sources of DNA damage are indicated in the boxes at the top of the figure in this section.[clarification needed]
Individuals with a germline mutation causing deficiency in any of 34 DNA repair genes (see article DNA repair-deficiency disorder) are at increased risk of cancer. Some germline mutations in DNA repair genes cause up to 100% lifetime chance of cancer (e.g., p53 mutations).[25] These germline mutations are indicated in a box at the left of the figure with an arrow indicating their contribution to DNA repair deficiency.
About 70% of malignant (cancerous) neoplasms have no hereditary component and are called "sporadic cancers".[26] Only a minority of sporadic cancers have a deficiency in DNA repair due to mutation in a DNA repair gene. However, a majority of sporadic cancers have deficiency in DNA repair due to epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence DNA repair gene expression. For example, of 113 sequential colorectal cancers, only four had a missense mutation in the DNA repair gene MGMT, while the majority had reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region (an epigenetic alteration).[27] Five reports present evidence that between 40% and 90% of colorectal cancers have reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region.[28][29][30][31][32]
Similarly, out of 119 cases of mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers that lacked DNA repair gene PMS2 expression, PMS2 was deficient in 6 due to mutations in the PMS2 gene, while in 103 cases PMS2 expression was deficient because its pairing partner MLH1 was repressed due to promoter methylation (PMS2 protein is unstable in the absence of MLH1).[33] In the other 10 cases, loss of PMS2 expression was likely due to epigenetic overexpression of the microRNA, miR-155, which down-regulates MLH1.[34]
In further examples, epigenetic defects were found at frequencies of between 13%-100% for the DNA repair genes BRCA1, WRN, FANCB, FANCF, MGMT, MLH1, MSH2, MSH4, ERCC1, XPF, NEIL1 and ATM. These epigenetic defects occurred in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, colorectal, and head and neck cancers. Two or three deficiencies in expression of ERCC1, XPF or PMS2 occur simultaneously in the majority of the 49 colon cancers evaluated by Facista et al.[35] Epigenetic alterations causing reduced expression of DNA repair genes is shown in a central box at the third level from the top of the figure in this section, and the consequent DNA repair deficiency is shown at the fourth level.
When expression of DNA repair genes is reduced, DNA damages accumulate in cells at a higher than normal level, and these excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation or epimutation. Mutation rates strongly increase in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair[36][37] or in homologous recombinational repair (HRR).[38]
During repair of DNA double strand breaks, or repair of other DNA damages, incompletely cleared sites of repair can cause epigenetic gene silencing.[39][40] DNA repair deficiencies (level 4 in the figure) cause increased DNA damages (level 5 in the figure) which result in increased somatic mutations and epigenetic alterations (level 6 in the figure).
Field defects, normal-appearing tissue with multiple alterations (and discussed in the section below), are common precursors to development of the disordered and improperly proliferating clone of tissue in a malignant neoplasm. Such field defects (second level from bottom of figure) may have multiple mutations and epigenetic alterations.
Once a cancer is formed, it usually has genome instability. This instability is likely due to reduced DNA repair or excessive DNA damage. Because of such instability, the cancer continues to evolve and to produce sub clones. For example, a renal cancer, sampled in 9 areas, had 40 ubiquitous mutations, demonstrating tumor heterogeneity (i.e. present in all areas of the cancer), 59 mutations shared by some (but not all areas), and 29 "private" mutations only present in one of the areas of the cancer.[41]
Various other terms have been used to describe this phenomenon, including field effect, field cancerization, and field carcinogenesis. The term field cancerization was first used in 1953 to describe an area or "field" of epithelium that has been preconditioned by (at that time) largely unknown processes so as to predispose it towards development of cancer.[42] Since then, the terms field cancerization and field defect have been used to describe pre-malignant tissue in which new cancers are likely to arise.[citation needed]
Field defects are important in progression to cancer.[43][44] However, in most cancer research, as pointed out by Rubin[45] "The vast majority of studies in cancer research has been done on well-defined tumors in vivo, or on discrete neoplastic foci in vitro. Yet there is evidence that more than 80% of the somatic mutations found in mutator phenotype human colorectal tumors occur before the onset of terminal clonal expansion.[46] Similarly, Vogelstein et al.[47] point out that more than half of somatic mutations identified in tumors occurred in a pre-neoplastic phase (in a field defect), during growth of apparently normal cells. Likewise, epigenetic alterations present in tumors may have occurred in pre-neoplastic field defects.[citation needed]
An expanded view of field effect has been termed "etiologic field effect", which encompasses not only molecular and pathologic changes in pre-neoplastic cells but also influences of exogenous environmental factors and molecular changes in the local microenvironment on neoplastic evolution from tumor initiation to patient death.[48]
In the colon, a field defect probably arises by natural selection of a mutant or epigenetically altered cell among the stem cells at the base of one of the intestinal crypts on the inside surface of the colon. A mutant or epigenetically altered stem cell may replace the other nearby stem cells by natural selection. Thus, a patch of abnormal tissue may arise. The figure in this section includes a photo of a freshly resected and lengthwise-opened segment of the colon showing a colon cancer and four polyps. Below the photo, there is a schematic diagram of how a large patch of mutant or epigenetically altered cells may have formed, shown by the large area in yellow in the diagram. Within this first large patch in the diagram (a large clone of cells), a second such mutation or epigenetic alteration may occur so that a given stem cell acquires an advantage compared to other stem cells within the patch, and this altered stem cell may expand clonally forming a secondary patch, or sub-clone, within the original patch. This is indicated in the diagram by four smaller patches of different colors within the large yellow original area. Within these new patches (sub-clones), the process may be repeated multiple times, indicated by the still smaller patches within the four secondary patches (with still different colors in the diagram) which clonally expand, until stem cells arise that generate either small polyps or else a malignant neoplasm (cancer).[citation needed]
In the photo, an apparent field defect in this segment of a colon has generated four polyps (labeled with the size of the polyps, 6mm, 5mm, and two of 3mm, and a cancer about 3 cm across in its longest dimension). These neoplasms are also indicated, in the diagram below the photo, by 4 small tan circles (polyps) and a larger red area (cancer). The cancer in the photo occurred in the cecal area of the colon, where the colon joins the small intestine (labeled) and where the appendix occurs (labeled). The fat in the photo is external to the outer wall of the colon.  In the segment of colon shown here, the colon was cut open lengthwise to expose the inner surface of the colon and to display the cancer and polyps occurring within the inner epithelial lining of the colon.[citation needed]
If the general process by which sporadic colon cancers arise is the formation of a pre-neoplastic clone that spreads by natural selection, followed by formation of internal sub-clones within the initial clone, and sub-sub-clones inside those, then colon cancers generally should be associated with, and be preceded by, fields of increasing abnormality reflecting the succession of premalignant events. The most extensive region of abnormality (the outermost yellow irregular area in the diagram) would reflect the earliest event in formation of a malignant neoplasm.[citation needed]
In experimental evaluation of specific DNA repair deficiencies in cancers, many specific DNA repair deficiencies were also shown to occur in the field defects surrounding those cancers. The Table, below, gives examples for which the DNA repair deficiency in a cancer was shown to be caused by an epigenetic alteration, and the somewhat lower frequencies with which the same epigenetically caused DNA repair deficiency was found in the surrounding field defect.
Some of the small polyps in the field defect shown in the photo of the opened colon segment may be relatively benign neoplasms. Of polyps less than 10mm in size, found during colonoscopy and followed with repeat colonoscopies for 3 years, 25% were unchanged in size, 35% regressed or shrank in size while 40% grew in size.[56]
Cancers are known to exhibit genome instability or a mutator phenotype.[57] The protein-coding DNA within the nucleus is about 1.5% of the total genomic DNA.[58] Within this protein-coding DNA (called the exome), an average cancer of the breast or colon can have about 60 to 70 protein altering mutations, of which about 3 or 4 may be "driver" mutations, and the remaining ones may be "passenger" mutations.[47] However, the average number of DNA sequence mutations in the entire genome (including non-protein-coding regions) within a breast cancer tissue sample is about 20,000.[59] In an average melanoma tissue sample (where melanomas have a higher exome mutation frequency[47]) the total number of DNA sequence mutations is about 80,000.[60] This compares to the very low mutation frequency of about 70 new mutations in the entire genome between generations (parent to child) in humans.[61][62]
The high frequencies of mutations in the total nucleotide sequences within cancers suggest that often an early alteration in the field defects giving rise to a cancer (e.g. yellow area in the diagram in this section) is a deficiency in DNA repair. The large field defects surrounding colon cancers (extending to at about 10 cm on each side of a cancer) were shown by Facista et al.[35] to frequently have epigenetic defects in 2 or 3 DNA repair proteins (ERCC1, XPF or PMS2) in the entire area of the field defect. Deficiencies in DNA repair cause increased mutation rates.[36][37][38] A deficiency in DNA repair, itself, can allow DNA damages to accumulate, and error-prone translesion synthesis past some of those damages may give rise to mutations. In addition, faulty repair of these accumulated DNA damages may give rise to epimutations. These new mutations or epimutations may provide a proliferative advantage, generating a field defect. Although the mutations/epimutations in DNA repair genes do not, themselves, confer a selective advantage, they may be carried along as passengers in cells when the cells acquire additional mutations/epimutations that do provide a proliferative advantage.[citation needed]
The term neoplasm is a synonym of tumor. Neoplasia denotes the process of the formation of neoplasms/tumors, and the process is referred to as a neoplastic process. The word neoplastic itself comes from Greek neo 'new' and plastic 'formed, molded'.[citation needed]
The term tumor derives from the Latin noun tumor 'a swelling', ultimately from the verb tumēre 'to swell'. In the British Commonwealth, the spelling tumour is commonly used, whereas in the U.S. the word is usually spelled tumor.[citation needed]
In its medical sense, tumor has traditionally meant an abnormal swelling of the flesh. The Roman medical encyclopedist Celsus (c. 30 BC–38 AD) described the four cardinal signs of acute inflammation as tumor, dolor, calor, and rubor (swelling, pain, increased heat, and redness). (His treatise, De Medicina, was the first medical book printed in 1478 following the invention of the movable-type printing press.)
In contemporary English, the word tumor is often used as a synonym for a cystic (liquid-filled) growth or solid neoplasm (cancerous or non-cancerous),[63] with other forms of swelling often referred to as "swellings".[64]
Related terms occur commonly in the medical literature, where the nouns tumefaction and tumescence (derived from the adjective tumescent)[65] are current medical terms for non-neoplastic swelling. This type of swelling is most often caused by inflammation caused by trauma, infection, and other factors.[citation needed]
Tumors may be caused by conditions other than an overgrowth of neoplastic cells, however. Cysts (such as sebaceous cysts) are also referred to as tumors, even though they have no neoplastic cells. This is standard in medical-billing terminology (especially when billing for a growth whose pathology has yet to be determined).[citation needed]

- Benign tumors include uterine fibroids, osteophytes, and melanocytic nevi (skin moles). They are circumscribed and localized and do not transform into cancer.[8]
- Potentially-malignant neoplasms include carcinoma in situ. They are localised, and do not invade and destroy but in time, may transform into cancer.
- Malignant neoplasms are commonly called cancer. They invade and destroy the surrounding tissue, may form metastases and, if untreated or unresponsive to treatment, will generally prove fatal.
- Secondary neoplasm refers to any of a class of cancerous tumor that is either a metastatic offshoot of a primary tumor, or an apparently unrelated tumor that increases in frequency following certain cancer treatments such as  chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
- Rarely there can be a metastatic neoplasm with no known site of the primary cancer and this is classed as a cancer of unknown primary origin.

==================================================
A computed tomography scan (CT scan),  formerly called computed axial tomography scan (CAT scan), is a medical imaging technique used to obtain detailed internal images of the body.[2] The personnel that perform CT scans are called radiographers or radiology technologists.[3][4]
CT scanners use a rotating X-ray tube and a row of detectors placed in a gantry to measure X-ray attenuations by different tissues inside the body. The multiple X-ray measurements taken from different angles are then processed on a computer using tomographic reconstruction algorithms to produce tomographic (cross-sectional) images (virtual "slices") of a body. CT scans can be used in patients with metallic implants or pacemakers, for whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is contraindicated.
Since its development in the 1970s, CT scanning has proven to be a versatile imaging technique. While CT is most prominently used in medical diagnosis, it can also be used to form images of non-living objects. The 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to South African-American physicist Allan MacLeod Cormack and British electrical engineer Godfrey Hounsfield "for the development of computer-assisted tomography".[5][6]
On the basis of image acquisition and procedures, various type of scanners are available in the market.
Sequential CT, also known as step-and-shoot CT, is a type of scanning method in which the CT table moves stepwise. The table increments to a particular location and then stops which is followed by the X-ray tube rotation and acquisition of a slice. The table then increments again, and another slice is taken. The table movement stops while taking slices. This results in an increased time of scanning.[7]
Spinning tube, commonly called spiral CT, or helical CT, is an imaging technique in which an entire X-ray tube is spun around the central axis of the area being scanned. These are the dominant type of scanners on the market because they have been manufactured longer and offer a lower cost of production and purchase. The main limitation of this type of CT is the bulk and inertia of the equipment (X-ray tube assembly and detector array on the opposite side of the circle) which limits the speed at which the equipment can spin. Some designs use two X-ray sources and detector arrays offset by an angle, as a technique to improve temporal resolution.[8][9]
Electron beam tomography
Electron beam tomography (EBT) is a specific form of CT in which a large enough X-ray tube is constructed so that only the path of the electrons, travelling between the cathode and anode of the X-ray tube, are spun using deflection coils.[10] This type had a major advantage since sweep speeds can be much faster, allowing for less blurry imaging of moving structures, such as the heart and arteries.[11] Fewer scanners of this design have been produced when compared with spinning tube types, mainly due to the higher cost associated with building a much larger X-ray tube and detector array and limited anatomical coverage.[12]
Dual energy CT, also known as spectral CT, is an advancement of computed Tomography in which two energies are used to create two sets of data.[13] A dual energy CT may employ dual source, single source with dual detector layer, single source with energy switching methods to get two different sets of data.[14]
CT perfusion imaging is a specific form of CT to assess flow through blood vessels whilst injecting a contrast agent.[21] Blood flow, blood transit time, and organ blood volume, can all be calculated with reasonable sensitivity and specificity.[21] This type of CT may be used on the heart, although sensitivity and specificity for detecting abnormalities are still lower than for other forms of CT.[22] This may also be used on the brain, where CT perfusion imaging can often detect poor brain perfusion well before it is detected using a conventional spiral CT scan.[21][23] This is better for stroke diagnosis than other CT types.[23]
Positron emission tomography–computed tomography is a hybrid CT modality which combines, in a single gantry, a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner and an X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner, to acquire sequential images from both devices in the same session, which are combined into a single superposed (co-registered) image. Thus, functional imaging obtained by PET, which depicts the spatial distribution of metabolic or biochemical activity in the body can be more precisely aligned or correlated with anatomic imaging obtained by CT scanning.[24]
PET-CT gives both anatomical and functional details of an organ under examination and is helpful in detecting different type of cancers.[25][26]
Since its introduction in the 1970s,[27] CT has become an important tool in medical imaging to supplement conventional X-ray imaging and medical ultrasonography. It has more recently been used for preventive medicine or screening for disease, for example, CT colonography for people with a high risk of colon cancer, or full-motion heart scans for people with a high risk of heart disease. Several institutions offer full-body scans for the general population although this practice goes against the advice and official position of many professional organizations in the field primarily due to the radiation dose applied.[28]
The use of CT scans has increased dramatically over the last two decades in many countries.[29] An estimated 72 million scans were performed in the United States in 2007 and more than 80 million in 2015.[30][31]
CT scanning of the head is typically used to detect infarction (stroke), tumors, calcifications, haemorrhage, and bone trauma.[32] Of the above, hypodense (dark) structures can indicate edema and infarction, hyperdense (bright) structures indicate calcifications and haemorrhage and bone trauma can be seen as disjunction in bone windows. Tumors can be detected by the swelling and anatomical distortion they cause, or by surrounding edema. CT scanning of the head is also used in CT-guided stereotactic surgery and radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations, and other surgically treatable conditions using a device known as the N-localizer.[33][34][35][36][37][38]
Contrast CT is generally the initial study of choice for neck masses in adults.[39] CT of the thyroid plays an important role in the evaluation of thyroid cancer.[40] CT scans often incidentally find thyroid abnormalities, and so is often the preferred investigation modality for thyroid abnormalities.[40]
A CT scan can be used for detecting both acute and chronic changes in the lung parenchyma, the tissue of the lungs.[41] It is particularly helpful because normal two-dimensional X-rays do not show such defects. A variety of techniques are used, depending on the suspected abnormality. For evaluation of chronic interstitial processes such as emphysema, and fibrosis,[42] thin sections with high spatial frequency reconstructions are used; often scans are performed both on inspiration and expiration. This special technique is called high resolution CT that produces a sampling of the lung, and not continuous images.[43]
Bronchial wall thickening can be seen on lung CTs and generally (but not always) implies inflammation of the bronchi.[44]
An incidentally found nodule in the absence of symptoms (sometimes referred to as an incidentaloma) may raise concerns that it might represent a tumor, either benign or malignant.[45] Perhaps persuaded by fear, patients and doctors sometimes agree to an intensive schedule of CT scans, sometimes up to every three months and beyond the recommended guidelines, in an attempt to do surveillance on the nodules.[46] However, established guidelines advise that patients without a prior history of cancer and whose solid nodules have not grown over a two-year period are unlikely to have any malignant cancer.[46] For this reason, and because no research provides supporting evidence that intensive surveillance gives better outcomes, and because of risks associated with having CT scans, patients should not receive CT screening in excess of those recommended by established guidelines.[46]
Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a type of contrast CT to visualize the arteries and veins throughout the body.[47] This ranges from arteries serving the brain to those bringing blood to the lungs, kidneys, arms and legs. An example of this type of exam is CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) used to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE). It employs computed tomography and an iodine-based contrast agent to obtain an image of the pulmonary arteries.[48][49][50] CT scans can reduce the risk of angiography by providing clinicians with more information about the positioning and number of clots prior to the procedure.[51][52]
A CT scan of the heart is performed to gain knowledge about cardiac or coronary anatomy.[53] Traditionally, cardiac CT scans are used to detect, diagnose, or follow up coronary artery disease.[54] More recently CT has played a key role in the fast-evolving field of transcatheter structural heart interventions, more specifically in the transcatheter repair and replacement of heart valves.[55][56][57]
The main forms of cardiac CT scanning are:
To better visualize the anatomy, post-processing of the images is common.[54] Most common are multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) and volume rendering. For more complex anatomies and procedures, such as heart valve interventions, a true 3D reconstruction or a 3D print is created based on these CT images to gain a deeper understanding.[62][63][64][65]
CT is an accurate technique for diagnosis of abdominal diseases such as Crohn's disease,[66] GIT bleeding, and diagnosis and staging of cancer, as well as follow-up after cancer treatment to assess response.[67] It is commonly used to investigate acute abdominal pain.[68]
Non-contrast-enhanced CT scans are the gold standard for diagnosing kidney stone disease.[69] They allow clinicians to estimate the size, volume, and density of stones, helping to guide further treatment; with size being especially important in predicting the time to spontaneous passage of a stone.[70]
Axial skeleton and extremities
For the axial skeleton and extremities, CT is often used to image complex fractures, especially ones around joints, because of its ability to reconstruct the area of interest in multiple planes. Fractures, ligamentous injuries, and dislocations can easily be recognized with a 0.2 mm resolution.[71][72] With modern dual-energy CT scanners, new areas of use have been established, such as aiding in the diagnosis of gout.[73]
CT is used in biomechanics to quickly reveal the geometry, anatomy, density and elastic moduli of biological tissues.[74][75]
Industrial CT scanning (industrial computed tomography) is a process which uses X-ray equipment to produce 3D representations of components both externally and internally. Industrial CT scanning has been used in many areas of industry for internal inspection of components. Some of the key uses for CT scanning have been flaw detection, failure analysis, metrology, assembly analysis, image-based finite element methods[76] and reverse engineering applications. CT scanning is also employed in the imaging and conservation of museum artifacts.[77]
CT scanning has also found an application in transport security (predominantly airport security) where it is currently used in a materials analysis context for explosives detection CTX (explosive-detection device)[78][79][80][81] and is also under consideration for automated baggage/parcel security scanning using computer vision based object recognition algorithms that target the detection of specific threat items based on 3D appearance (e.g. guns, knives, liquid containers).[82][83][84] Its usage in airport security pioneered at Shannon Airport in March 2022 has ended the ban on liquids over 100 ml there, a move that Heathrow Airport plans for a full roll-out on 1 December 2022 and the TSA spent $781.2 million on an order for over 1,000 scanners, ready to go live in the summer.
X-ray CT is used in geological studies to quickly reveal materials inside a drill core.[85] Dense minerals such as pyrite and barite appear brighter and less dense components such as clay appear dull in CT images.[86]
Traditional methods of studying fossils are often destructive, such as the use of thin sections and physical preparation. X-ray CT is used in paleontology to non-destructively visualize fossils in 3D.[87] This has many advantages. For example, we can look at fragile structures that might never otherwise be able to be studied. In addition, one can freely move around models of fossils in virtual 3D space to inspect it without damaging the fossil.
Cultural heritage use
X-ray CT and micro-CT can also be used for the conservation and preservation of objects of cultural heritage. For many fragile objects, direct research and observation can be damaging and can degrade the object over time. Using CT scans, conservators and researchers are able to determine the material composition of the objects they are exploring, such as the position of ink along the layers of a scroll, without any additional harm. These scans have been optimal for research focused on the workings of the Antikythera mechanism or the text hidden inside the charred outer layers of the En-Gedi Scroll. However, they are not optimal for every object subject to these kinds of research questions, as there are certain artifacts like the Herculaneum papyri in which the material composition has very little variation along the inside of the object. After scanning these objects, computational methods can be employed to examine the insides of these objects, as was the case with the virtual unwrapping of the En-Gedi scroll and the Herculaneum papyri.[88] Micro-CT has also proved useful for analyzing more recent artifacts such as still-sealed historic correspondence that employed the technique of letterlocking (complex folding and cuts) that provided a "tamper-evident locking mechanism".[89][90] Further examples of use cases in archaeology is imaging the contents of sarcophagi or ceramics.[91]
Recently, CWI in Amsterdam has collaborated with Rijksmuseum to investigate art object inside details in the framework called IntACT.[92]
Microorganism research
Varied types of fungus can degrade wood to different degrees, one Belgium research group has been used X-ray CT 3 dimension with sub-micron resolution unveiled fungi can penetrate micropores of 0.6 μm[93] under certain conditions.
Sawmills use industrial CT scanners to detect round defects, for instance knots, to improve total value of timber productions. Most sawmills are planning to incorporate this robust detection tool to improve productivity in the long run, however initial investment cost is high.[94]
Interpretation of results
The result of a CT scan is a volume of voxels, which may be presented to a human observer by various methods, which broadly fit into the following categories:
Technically, all volume renderings become projections when viewed on a 2-dimensional display, making the distinction between projections and volume renderings a bit vague. The epitomes of volume rendering models feature a mix of for example coloring and shading in order to create realistic and observable representations.[99][100]
Two-dimensional CT images are conventionally rendered so that the view is as though looking up at it from the patient's feet.[101] Hence, the left side of the image is to the patient's right and vice versa, while anterior in the image also is the patient's anterior and vice versa. This left-right interchange corresponds to the view that physicians generally have in reality when positioned in front of patients.[102]
Pixels in an image obtained by CT scanning are displayed in terms of relative radiodensity. The pixel itself is displayed according to the mean attenuation of the tissue(s) that it corresponds to on a scale from +3,071 (most attenuating) to −1,024 (least attenuating) on the Hounsfield scale. A pixel is a two dimensional unit based on the matrix size and the field of view. When the CT slice thickness is also factored in, the unit is known as a voxel, which is a three-dimensional unit.[103] Water has an attenuation of 0 Hounsfield units (HU), while air is −1,000 HU, cancellous bone is typically +400 HU, and cranial bone can reach 2,000 HU.[104] The attenuation of metallic implants depends on the atomic number of the element used: Titanium usually has an amount of +1000 HU, iron steel can completely block the X-ray and is, therefore, responsible for well-known line-artifacts in computed tomograms. Artifacts are caused by abrupt transitions between low- and high-density materials, which results in data values that exceed the dynamic range of the processing electronics.[105]
CT data sets have a very high dynamic range which must be reduced for display or printing. This is typically done via a process of "windowing", which maps a range (the "window") of pixel values to a grayscale ramp. For example, CT images of the brain are commonly viewed with a window extending from 0 HU to 80 HU. Pixel values of 0 and lower, are displayed as black; values of 80 and higher are displayed as white; values within the window are displayed as a gray intensity proportional to position within the window.[106] The window used for display must be matched to the X-ray density of the object of interest, in order to optimize the visible detail.[107] Window width and window level parameters are used to control the windowing of a scan.[108]
Multiplanar reconstruction and projections
Multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) is the process of converting data from one anatomical plane (usually transverse) to other planes. It can be used for thin slices as well as projections. Multiplanar reconstruction is possible as present CT scanners provide almost isotropic resolution.[109]
MPR is used almost in every scan. The spine is frequently examined with it.[110] An image of the spine in axial plane can only show one vertebral bone at a time and cannot show its relation with other vertebral bones. By reformatting the data in other planes, visualization of the relative position can be achieved in sagittal and coronal plane.[111]
New software allows the reconstruction of data in non-orthogonal (oblique) planes, which help in the visualization of organs which are not in orthogonal planes.[112][113] It is better suited for visualization of the anatomical structure of the bronchi as they do not lie orthogonal to the direction of the scan.[114]
Curved-plane reconstruction (or curved planar reformation = CPR) is performed mainly for the evaluation of vessels. This type of reconstruction helps to straighten the bends in a vessel, thereby helping to visualize a whole vessel in a single image or in multiple images. After a vessel has been "straightened", measurements such as cross-sectional area and length can be made. This is helpful in preoperative assessment of a surgical procedure.[115]
For 2D projections used in radiation therapy for quality assurance and planning of external beam radiotherapy, including digitally reconstructed radiographs, see Beam's eye view.
A threshold value of radiodensity is set by the operator (e.g., a level that corresponds to bone). With the help of edge detection image processing algorithms a 3D model can be constructed from the initial data and displayed on screen. Various thresholds can be used to get multiple models, each anatomical component such as muscle, bone and cartilage can be differentiated on the basis of different colours given to them. However, this mode of operation cannot show interior structures.[117]
Surface rendering is limited technique as it displays only the surfaces that meet a particular threshold density, and which are towards the viewer. However, In volume rendering, transparency, colours and shading are used which makes it easy to present a volume in a single image. For example, Pelvic bones could be displayed as semi-transparent, so that, even viewing at an oblique angle one part of the image does not hide another.[118]
Dose versus image quality
An important issue within radiology today is how to reduce the radiation dose during CT examinations without compromising the image quality. In general, higher radiation doses result in higher-resolution images,[119] while lower doses lead to increased image noise and unsharp images. However, increased dosage raises the adverse side effects, including the risk of radiation-induced cancer – a four-phase abdominal CT gives the same radiation dose as 300 chest X-rays.[120] Several methods that can reduce the exposure to ionizing radiation during a CT scan exist.[121]
Although images produced by CT are generally faithful representations of the scanned volume, the technique is susceptible to a number of artifacts, such as the following:[125][126]Chapters 3 and 5
CT scanning has several advantages over traditional two-dimensional medical radiography. First, CT eliminates the superimposition of images of structures outside the area of interest.[141] Second, CT scans have greater image resolution, enabling examination of finer details. CT can distinguish between tissues that differ in  radiographic density by 1% or less.[142] Third, CT scanning enables multiplanar reformatted imaging: scan data can be visualized in the transverse (or axial), coronal, or sagittal plane, depending on the diagnostic task.[143]
The improved resolution of CT has permitted the development of new investigations. For example, CT angiography avoids the invasive insertion of a catheter. CT scanning can perform a virtual colonoscopy with greater accuracy and less discomfort for the patient than a traditional colonoscopy.[144][145] Virtual colonography is far more accurate than a barium enema for detection of tumors and uses a lower radiation dose.[146]
CT is a moderate-to-high radiation diagnostic technique. The radiation dose for a particular examination depends on multiple factors: volume scanned, patient build, number and type of scan protocol, and desired resolution and image quality.[147] Two helical CT scanning parameters, tube current and pitch, can be adjusted easily and have a profound effect on radiation. CT scanning is more accurate than two-dimensional radiographs in evaluating anterior interbody fusion, although they may still over-read the extent of fusion.[148]
The radiation used in CT scans can damage body cells, including DNA molecules, which can lead to radiation-induced cancer.[149] The radiation doses received from CT scans is variable. Compared to the lowest dose X-ray techniques, CT scans can have 100 to 1,000 times higher dose than conventional X-rays.[150] However, a lumbar spine X-ray has a similar dose as a head CT.[151] Articles in the media often exaggerate the relative dose of CT by comparing the lowest-dose X-ray techniques (chest X-ray) with the highest-dose CT techniques. In general, a routine abdominal CT has a radiation dose similar to three years of average background radiation.[152]
Large scale population-based studies have consistently demonstrated that low dose radiation from CT scans has impacts on cancer incidence in a variety of cancers.[153][154][155][156] For example, in a large population-based Australian cohort it was found that up to 3.7% of brain cancers were caused by CT scan radiation.[157] Some experts project that in the future, between three and five percent of all cancers would result from medical imaging.[150] An Australian study of 10.9 million people reported that the increased incidence of cancer after CT scan exposure in this cohort was mostly due to irradiation. In this group, one in every 1,800 CT scans was followed by an excess cancer. If the lifetime risk of developing cancer is 40% then the absolute risk rises to 40.05% after a CT. The risks of CT scan radiation are especially important in patients undergoing recurrent CT scans within a short time span of one to five years.[158][159][160]
Some experts note that CT scans are known to be "overused," and "there is distressingly little evidence of better health outcomes associated with the current high rate of scans."[150] On the other hand, a recent paper analyzing the data of patients who received high cumulative doses showed a high degree of appropriate use.[161] This creates an important issue of cancer risk to these patients. Moreover, a highly significant finding that was previously unreported is that some patients received >100 mSv dose from CT scans in a single day,[159] which counteracts existing criticisms some investigators may have on the effects of protracted versus acute exposure.
There are contrarian views and the debate is ongoing. Some studies have shown that publications indicating an increased risk of cancer from typical doses of body CT scans are plagued with serious methodological limitations and several highly improbable results,[162] concluding that no evidence indicates such low doses cause any long-term harm.[163][164][165]
One study estimated that as many as 0.4% of cancers in the United States resulted from CT scans, and that this may have increased to as much as 1.5 to 2% based on the rate of CT use in 2007.[149] Others dispute this estimate,[166] as there is no consensus that the low levels of radiation used in CT scans cause damage. Lower radiation doses are used in many cases, such as in the investigation of renal colic.[167]
A person's age plays a significant role in the subsequent risk of cancer.[168] Estimated lifetime cancer mortality risks from an abdominal CT of a one-year-old is 0.1%, or 1:1000 scans.[168] The risk for someone who is 40 years old is half that of someone who is 20 years old with substantially less risk in the elderly.[168] The International Commission on Radiological Protection estimates that the risk to a fetus being exposed to 10 mGy (a unit of radiation exposure) increases the rate of cancer before 20 years of age from 0.03% to 0.04% (for reference a CT pulmonary angiogram exposes a fetus to 4 mGy).[169] A 2012 review did not find an association between medical radiation and cancer risk in children noting however the existence of limitations in the evidences over which the review is based.[170] CT scans can be performed with different settings for lower exposure in children with most manufacturers of CT scans as of 2007 having this function built in.[171] Furthermore, certain conditions can require children to be exposed to multiple CT scans.[149]
Current recommendations are to inform patients of the risks of CT scanning.[172] However, employees of imaging centers tend not to communicate such risks unless patients ask.[173]
In the United States half of CT scans are contrast CTs using intravenously injected radiocontrast agents.[174] The most common reactions from these agents are mild, including nausea, vomiting, and an itching rash. Severe life-threatening reactions may rarely occur.[175] Overall reactions occur in 1 to 3% with nonionic contrast and 4 to 12% of people with ionic contrast.[176] Skin rashes may appear within a week to 3% of people.[175]
The old radiocontrast agents caused anaphylaxis in 1% of cases while the newer, low-osmolar agents cause reactions in 0.01–0.04% of cases.[175][177] Death occurs in about 2 to 30 people per 1,000,000 administrations, with newer agents being safer.[176][178]
There is a higher risk of mortality in those who are female, elderly or in poor health, usually secondary to either anaphylaxis or acute kidney injury.[174]
The contrast agent may induce contrast-induced nephropathy.[179] This occurs in 2 to 7% of people who receive these agents, with greater risk in those who have preexisting kidney failure,[179] preexisting diabetes, or reduced intravascular volume. People with mild kidney impairment are usually advised to ensure full hydration for several hours before and after the injection. For moderate kidney failure, the use of iodinated contrast should be avoided; this may mean using an alternative technique instead of CT. Those with severe kidney failure requiring dialysis require less strict precautions, as their kidneys have so little function remaining that any further damage would not be noticeable and the dialysis will remove the contrast agent; it is normally recommended, however, to arrange dialysis as soon as possible following contrast administration to minimize any adverse effects of the contrast.
In addition to the use of intravenous contrast, orally administered contrast agents are frequently used when examining the abdomen.[180] These are frequently the same as the intravenous contrast agents, merely diluted to approximately 10% of the concentration. However, oral alternatives to iodinated contrast exist, such as very dilute (0.5–1% w/v) barium sulfate suspensions. Dilute barium sulfate has the advantage that it does not cause allergic-type reactions or kidney failure, but cannot be used in patients with suspected bowel perforation or suspected bowel injury, as leakage of barium sulfate from damaged bowel can cause fatal peritonitis.[181]
Side effects from contrast agents, administered intravenously in some CT scans, might impair kidney performance in patients with kidney disease, although this risk is now believed to be lower than previously thought.[182][179]
The table reports average radiation exposures; however, there can be a wide variation in radiation doses between similar scan types, where the highest dose could be as much as 22 times higher than the lowest dose.[168] A typical plain film X-ray involves radiation dose of 0.01 to 0.15 mGy, while a typical CT can involve 10–20 mGy for specific organs, and can go up to 80 mGy for certain specialized CT scans.[185]
For purposes of comparison, the world average dose rate from naturally occurring sources of background radiation is 2.4 mSv per year, equal for practical purposes in this application to 2.4 mGy per year.[183] While there is some variation, most people (99%) received less than 7 mSv per year as background radiation.[187] Medical imaging as of 2007 accounted for half of the radiation exposure of those in the United States with CT scans making up two thirds of this amount.[168] In the United Kingdom it accounts for 15% of radiation exposure.[169] The average radiation dose from medical sources is ≈0.6 mSv per person globally as of 2007.[168] Those in the nuclear industry in the United States are limited to doses of 50 mSv a year and 100 mSv every 5 years.[168]
Lead is the main material used by radiography personnel for shielding against scattered X-rays.
The radiation dose reported in the gray or mGy unit is proportional to the amount of energy that the irradiated body part is expected to absorb, and the physical effect (such as DNA double strand breaks) on the cells' chemical bonds by X-ray radiation is proportional to that energy.[188]
The sievert unit is used in the report of the effective dose. The sievert unit, in the context of CT scans, does not correspond to the actual radiation dose that the scanned body part absorbs but to another radiation dose of another scenario, the whole body absorbing the other radiation dose and the other radiation dose being of a magnitude, estimated to have the same probability to induce cancer as the CT scan.[189] Thus, as is shown in the table above, the actual radiation that is absorbed by a scanned body part is often much larger than the effective dose suggests. A specific measure, termed the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), is commonly used as an estimate of the radiation absorbed dose for tissue within the scan region, and is automatically computed by medical CT scanners.[190]
The equivalent dose is the effective dose of a case, in which the whole body would actually absorb the same radiation dose, and the sievert unit is used in its report. In the case of non-uniform radiation, or radiation given to only part of the body, which is common for CT examinations, using the local equivalent dose alone would overstate the biological risks to the entire organism.[191][192][193]
Most adverse health effects of radiation exposure may be grouped in two general categories:
The added lifetime risk of developing cancer by a single abdominal CT of 8 mSv is estimated to be 0.05%, or 1 one in 2,000.[196]
Because of increased susceptibility of fetuses to radiation exposure, the radiation dosage of a CT scan is an important consideration in the choice of medical imaging in pregnancy.[197][198]
In October, 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated an investigation of brain perfusion CT (PCT) scans, based on radiation burns caused by incorrect settings at one particular facility for this particular type of CT scan. Over 200 patients were exposed to radiation at approximately eight times the expected dose for an 18-month period; over 40% of them lost patches of hair. This event prompted a call for increased CT quality assurance programs. It was noted that "while unnecessary radiation exposure should be avoided, a medically needed CT scan obtained with appropriate acquisition parameter has benefits that outweigh the radiation risks."[168][199] Similar problems have been reported at other centers.[168] These incidents are believed to be due to human error.[168]
CT scan procedure varies according to the type of the study and the organ being imaged. The patient lies on the CT table and the centering of the table is done according to the body part. The IV line is established in case of contrast-enhanced CT. After selecting proper[clarification needed] and rate of contrast from the pressure injector, the scout is taken to localize and plan the scan. Once the plan is selected, the contrast is given. The raw data is processed according to the study and proper windowing is done to make scans easy to diagnose.[200]
Patient preparation may vary according to the type of scan. The general patient preparation includes.[200]
Computed tomography operates by using an X-ray generator that rotates around the object; X-ray detectors are positioned on the opposite side of the circle from the X-ray source.[203] As the X-rays pass through the patient, they are attenuated differently by various tissues according to the tissue density.[204] A visual representation of the raw data obtained is called a sinogram, yet it is not sufficient for interpretation.[205] Once the scan data has been acquired, the data must be processed using a form of tomographic reconstruction, which produces a series of cross-sectional images.[206] These cross-sectional images are made up of small units of pixels or voxels.[207]
Pixels in an image obtained by CT scanning are displayed in terms of relative radiodensity. The pixel itself is displayed according to the mean attenuation of the tissue(s) that it corresponds to on a scale from +3,071 (most attenuating) to −1,024 (least attenuating) on the Hounsfield scale. A pixel is a two dimensional unit based on the matrix size and the field of view. When the CT slice thickness is also factored in, the unit is known as a voxel, which is a three-dimensional unit.[207]
Water has an attenuation of 0 Hounsfield units (HU), while air is −1,000 HU, cancellous bone is typically +400 HU, and cranial bone can reach 2,000 HU or more (os temporale) and can cause artifacts. The attenuation of metallic implants depends on the atomic number of the element used: Titanium usually has an amount of +1000 HU, iron steel can completely extinguish the X-ray and is, therefore, responsible for well-known line-artifacts in computed tomograms. Artifacts are caused by abrupt transitions between low- and high-density materials, which results in data values that exceed the dynamic range of the processing electronics. Two-dimensional CT images are conventionally rendered so that the view is as though looking up at it from the patient's feet.[101] Hence, the left side of the image is to the patient's right and vice versa, while anterior in the image also is the patient's anterior and vice versa. This left-right interchange corresponds to the view that physicians generally have in reality when positioned in front of patients.
Initially, the images generated in CT scans were in the transverse (axial) anatomical plane, perpendicular to the long axis of the body. Modern scanners allow the scan data to be reformatted as images in other planes. Digital geometry processing can generate a three-dimensional image of an object inside the body from a series of two-dimensional radiographic images taken by rotation around a fixed axis.[125] These cross-sectional images are widely used for medical diagnosis and therapy.[208]
Contrast media used for X-ray CT, as well as for plain film X-ray, are called radiocontrasts. Radiocontrasts for CT are, in general, iodine-based.[209] This is useful to highlight structures such as blood vessels that otherwise would be difficult to delineate from their surroundings. Using contrast material can also help to obtain functional information about tissues. Often, images are taken both with and without radiocontrast.[210]
The history of X-ray computed tomography goes back to at least 1917 with the mathematical theory of the Radon transform.[211][212] In October 1963, William H. Oldendorf received a U.S. patent for a "radiant energy apparatus for investigating selected areas of interior objects obscured by dense material".[213] The first commercially viable CT scanner was invented by Godfrey Hounsfield in 1972.[214]
It is often claimed that revenues from the sales of The Beatles' records in the 1960s helped fund the development of the first CT scanner at EMI. The first production X-ray CT machines were in fact called EMI scanners.[215]
The word tomography is derived from the Greek tome 'slice' and graphein 'to write'.[216] Computed tomography was originally known as the "EMI scan" as it was developed in the early 1970s at a research branch of EMI, a company best known today for its music and recording business.[217] It was later known as computed axial tomography (CAT or CT scan) and body section röntgenography.[218]
The term CAT scan is no longer in technical use because current CT scans enable for multiplanar reconstructions. This makes CT scan the most appropriate term, which is used by radiologists in common vernacular as well as in textbooks and scientific papers.[219][220][221]
In Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), computed axial tomography was used from 1977 to 1979, but the current indexing explicitly includes X-ray in the title.[222]
The term sinogram was introduced by Paul Edholm and Bertil Jacobson in 1975.[223]
In response to increased concern by the public and the ongoing progress of best practices, the Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging was formed within the Society for Pediatric Radiology. In concert with the American Society of Radiologic Technologists, the American College of Radiology and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, the Society for Pediatric Radiology developed and launched the Image Gently Campaign which is designed to maintain high-quality imaging studies while using the lowest doses and best radiation safety practices available on pediatric patients.[225] This initiative has been endorsed and applied by a growing list of various professional medical organizations around the world and has received support and assistance from companies that manufacture equipment used in Radiology.
Following upon the success of the Image Gently campaign, the American College of Radiology, the Radiological Society of North America, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine and the American Society of Radiologic Technologists have launched a similar campaign to address this issue in the adult population called Image Wisely.[226]
The World Health Organization and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the United Nations have also been working in this area and have ongoing projects designed to broaden best practices and lower patient radiation dose.[227][228]
Use of CT has increased dramatically over the last two decades.[29] An estimated 72 million scans were performed in the United States in 2007,[30] accounting for close to half of the total per-capita dose rate from radiologic and nuclear medicine procedures.[229] Of the CT scans, six to eleven percent are done in children,[169] an increase of seven to eightfold from 1980.[168] Similar increases have been seen in Europe and Asia.[168] In Calgary, Canada, 12.1% of people who present to the emergency with an urgent complaint received a CT scan, most commonly either of the head or of the abdomen. The percentage who received CT, however, varied markedly by the emergency physician who saw them from 1.8% to 25%.[230] In the emergency department in the United States, CT or MRI imaging is done in 15% of people who present with injuries as of 2007 (up from 6% in 1998).[231]
The increased use of CT scans has been the greatest in two fields: screening of adults (screening CT of the lung in smokers, virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, and whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients) and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the scanning time to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, is one of the main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population (especially for the diagnosis of appendicitis).[149] As of 2007, in the United States a proportion of CT scans are performed unnecessarily.[171] Some estimates place this number at 30%.[169] There are a number of reasons for this including: legal concerns, financial incentives, and desire by the public.[171] For example, some healthy people avidly pay to receive full-body CT scans as screening. In that case, it is not at all clear that the benefits outweigh the risks and costs. Deciding whether and how to treat incidentalomas is complex, radiation exposure is not negligible, and the money for the scans involves opportunity cost.[171]
Major manufacturers of CT scanning devices and equipment are:[232]
Photon-counting computed tomography is a CT technique currently under development.[as of?] Typical CT scanners use energy integrating detectors; photons are measured as a voltage on a capacitor which is proportional to the X-rays detected. However, this technique is susceptible to noise and other factors which can affect the linearity of the voltage to X-ray intensity relationship.[233] Photon counting detectors (PCDs) are still affected by noise but it does not change the measured counts of photons. PCDs have several potential advantages, including improving signal (and contrast) to noise ratios, reducing doses, improving spatial resolution, and through use of several energies, distinguishing multiple contrast agents.[234][235] PCDs have only recently become feasible in CT scanners due to improvements in detector technologies that can cope with the volume and rate of data required. As of February 2016, photon counting CT is in use at three sites.[236] Some early research has found the dose reduction potential of photon counting CT for breast imaging to be very promising.[237] In view of recent findings of high cumulative doses to patients from recurrent CT scans, there has been a push for scanning technologies and techniques that reduce ionising radiation doses to patients to sub-milliSievert (sub-mSv in the literature) levels during the CT scan process, a goal that has been lingering.[238][159][160][161]
- computed tomography
- CAT scan (computerized axial tomography,[1] computer aided tomography)
- X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography)
- Dual source CT is an advanced scanner with a two X-ray tube detector system, unlike conventional single tube systems.[15][16] These two detector systems are mounted on a single gantry at 90° in the same plane.[17] Dual source CT scanners allow fast scanning with higher temporal resolution by acquiring a full CT slice in only half a rotation. Fast imaging reduces motion blurring at high heart rates and potentially allowing for shorter breath-hold time. This is particularly useful for ill patients having difficulty holding their breath or unable to take heart-rate lowering medication.[17][18]
- Single source with energy switching is another mode of dual energy CT in which a single tube is operated at two different energies by switching the energies frequently.[19][20]
- Coronary CT angiography (CCTA): the use of CT to assess the coronary arteries of the heart. The subject receives an intravenous injection of radiocontrast, and then the heart is scanned using a high-speed CT scanner, allowing radiologists to assess the extent of occlusion in the coronary arteries, usually to diagnose coronary artery disease.[58][59]
- Coronary CT calcium scan: also used for the assessment of severity of coronary artery disease. Specifically, it looks for calcium deposits in the coronary arteries that can narrow arteries and increase the risk of a heart attack.[60] A typical coronary CT calcium scan is done without the use of radiocontrast, but it can possibly be done from contrast-enhanced images as well.[61]
- Slices (of varying thickness). Thin slice is generally regarded as planes representing a thickness of less than 3 mm.[95][96] Thick slice is generally regarded as planes representing a thickness between 3 mm and 5 mm.[96][97]
- Projection, including maximum intensity projection[98] and average intensity projection
- Volume rendering (VR)[98]
- New software technology can significantly reduce the required radiation dose. New iterative tomographic reconstruction algorithms (e.g., iterative Sparse Asymptotic Minimum Variance) could offer super-resolution without requiring higher radiation dose.[122]
- Individualize the examination and adjust the radiation dose to the body type and body organ examined. Different body types and organs require different amounts of radiation.[123]
- Higher resolution is not always suitable, such as detection of small pulmonary masses.[124]
- deterministic effects (harmful tissue reactions) due in large part to the killing/malfunction of cells following high doses;[194]
- stochastic effects, i.e., cancer and heritable effects involving either cancer development in exposed individuals owing to mutation of somatic cells or heritable disease in their offspring owing to mutation of reproductive (germ) cells.[195]
- Signing the informed consent.
- Removal of metallic objects and jewelry from the region of interest.
- Changing to the hospital gown according to hospital protocol.
- Checking of kidney function, especially creatinine and urea levels (in case of CECT).[201]

==================================================
Le mot « cancer » est un terme générique désignant un large groupe de maladies pouvant toucher n’importe quelle partie de l’organisme. On parle aussi de tumeurs malignes et de néoplasmes. L’un des traits caractéristiques du cancer est la multiplication rapide de cellules anormales à la croissance inhabituelle, qui peuvent ensuite envahir des parties voisines de l’organisme, puis migrer vers d’autres organes. On parle alors de métastases. La présence de métastases étendues est la principale cause de décès par cancer.
À l’origine de près de 10 millions de décès en 2020, le cancer est l’une des principales causes de mortalité dans le monde (1). En 2020, les cancers les plus courants (en termes de nombre de cas recensés) étaient les suivants :
En 2020, les cancers à l’origine du plus grand nombre de décès étaient :
Chaque année, un cancer est diagnostiqué chez quelque 400 000 enfants. Les cancers les plus courants varient d’un pays à l’autre. Le cancer du col de l’utérus est le plus fréquent dans 23 pays.
Qu’est-ce qui provoque le cancer ?
Le cancer naît de la transformation de cellules normales en cellules tumorales, un processus en plusieurs étapes qui a généralement pour point de départ une lésion précancéreuse, laquelle devient ensuite une tumeur maligne. Ces mutations sont la conséquence d’interactions entre des facteurs génétiques propres au sujet et des agents extérieurs classés en trois catégories, à savoir :
Par le biais de son institution spécialisée, le Centre international de recherche sur le cancer (CIRC), l’OMS tient à jour cette classification des agents cancérogènes.
L’incidence du cancer croît considérablement avec l’âge, très vraisemblablement en raison de l’accumulation croissante de facteurs de risque de cancers spécifiques, et du fait que les mécanismes de régénération cellulaire tendent généralement à perdre en efficacité au fur et à mesure du vieillissement.
Facteurs de risque de cancer
Le tabagisme, la consommation d’alcool, une mauvaise alimentation, un manque d’activité physique et la pollution de l’air sont autant de facteurs de risque de cancer (et d’autres maladies non transmissibles).
Certaines infections chroniques constituent elles aussi des facteurs de risque de cancer, en particulier dans les pays à revenu faible ou intermédiaire. Environ 13 % des cancers diagnostiqués dans le monde en 2018 étaient imputables à des infections cancérogènes, notamment celles dues à Helicobacter pylori, au papillomavirus humain (PVH), au virus de l’hépatite B, au virus de l’hépatite C et au virus d’Epstein Barr (2).
Les virus de l’hépatite B et de l’hépatite C augmentent le risque de cancer du foie, tandis que certains types de PVH majorent le risque de cancer du col de l’utérus. L’infection à VIH multiplie par six le risque de développer un cancer du col de l’utérus et accroît fortement le risque de développer certains autres cancers comme le sarcome de Kaposi.
Réduire la charge du cancer
À l’heure actuelle, 30 à 50 % des cancers peuvent être prévenus en évitant les facteurs de risque et en appliquant des stratégies préventives reposant sur des données probantes. On peut aussi réduire la charge du cancer grâce à une détection précoce et à un traitement et une prise en charge appropriés des patients. Nombre de cancers présentent une probabilité de guérison élevée s’ils sont détectés rapidement et traités de manière appropriée.
Le risque de cancer peut être réduit :
La détection et le traitement rapide des cas permettent de réduire la mortalité liée au cancer. La détection précoce repose sur deux éléments : le diagnostic précoce et le dépistage.
Un traitement est plus susceptible d’être efficace – avec des chances de survie accrues, une réduction de la morbidité et des coûts moins élevés – si le cancer est diagnostiqué rapidement. En détectant les cancers à un stade précoce et en évitant des retards dans le traitement, on peut sensiblement améliorer la vie des patients.
Le diagnostic précoce comporte trois volets :
Le diagnostic précoce des cas symptomatiques est important dans tous les contextes et pour la majorité des cancers. Les programmes de lutte contre le cancer doivent avoir pour but de réduire les retards et les obstacles en matière de diagnostic, de traitement et d’accès aux soins de soutien.
Le dépistage vise à identifier les personnes dont les résultats de tests sont évocateurs d’un cancer ou d’un pré-cancer particulier avant qu’elles ne développent des symptômes. Lorsque le dépistage met en évidence des anomalies, des examens supplémentaires doivent être réalisés pour établir un diagnostic définitif et le patient doit être orienté vers des services de traitement si la présence d’un cancer est avérée.
Les programmes de dépistage sont efficaces pour certains types de cancer, mais pas tous. En règle générale, ils sont bien plus complexes et requièrent beaucoup plus de ressources que le diagnostic précoce, car ils nécessitent des équipements et du personnel spécialisés. Même lorsqu’il existe des programmes de dépistage, des programmes de diagnostic précoce demeurent nécessaires pour identifier les cas de cancer parmi les personnes qui ne répondent pas aux critères d’âge ou de facteur de risque établis pour le dépistage.
Pour éviter un taux excessif de faux positifs, la sélection des patients pouvant bénéficier d’un dépistage se fonde sur l’âge et les facteurs de risque. Parmi les méthodes de dépistage employées figurent notamment :
Les programmes de dépistage comme de diagnostic précoce nécessitent une assurance qualité.
Il est essentiel de diagnostiquer correctement un cancer pour le traiter de façon adaptée et efficace, car chaque type de cancer nécessite un protocole de traitement spécifique. Le traitement du cancer repose généralement sur la chirurgie, la radiothérapie et/ou un traitement systémique (chimiothérapie, traitements hormonaux, thérapies biologiques ciblées). Le choix du protocole thérapeutique dépendra à la fois du cancer à traiter et du profil du patient. Il est important que le protocole soit achevé dans un laps de temps défini pour obtenir le résultat thérapeutique attendu.
Il est essentiel de commencer par définir les objectifs du traitement. Le principal objectif est généralement de guérir le patient ou de prolonger considérablement sa vie. Un autre objectif important est d’améliorer la qualité de vie du patient, ce qui peut être accompli en prodiguant des soins contribuant à son bien-être physique, psychosocial et spirituel, ainsi qu’en offrant des soins palliatifs en phase terminale de cancer.
S’ils sont décelés rapidement et traités selon les meilleures pratiques, certains des types de cancer les plus répandus, comme le cancer du sein, le cancer du col de l’utérus, le cancer de la cavité buccale et le cancer colorectal, ont une probabilité de guérison élevée.
D’autres types de cancer, comme le séminome testiculaire ou différents types de leucémies et de lymphomes chez l’enfant, présentent eux aussi des taux de rétablissement élevés s’ils sont traités correctement, même dans les cas où des cellules cancéreuses se sont propagées dans d’autres parties de l’organisme.
Cependant, la disponibilité des traitements varie sensiblement entre les pays en fonction de leur niveau de revenu ; selon les informations disponibles, les patients peuvent bénéficier d’un traitement complet dans plus de 90 % des pays à revenu élevé, contre moins de 15 % des pays à faible revenu (3).
Les soins palliatifs ne visent pas à guérir le cancer, mais à atténuer les symptômes et les souffrances qui en résultent, ainsi qu’à améliorer la qualité de vie des patients et de leurs proches. Les soins palliatifs peuvent aider les personnes à vivre plus confortablement. Ils sont particulièrement importants dans les lieux comptant une proportion élevée de patients atteints d’un cancer à un stade avancé, pour lesquels les chances de guérison sont minces.
Les soins palliatifs peuvent contribuer à atténuer les problèmes physiques, psychosociaux et spirituels chez plus de 90 % des patients atteints d’un cancer à un stade avancé.
Pour dispenser des soins palliatifs aux patients et soulager leur douleur ainsi que celle de leurs proches, il est essentiel de mettre en œuvre des stratégies de santé publique efficaces, prévoyant une prise en charge au niveau communautaire et à domicile.
Il est fortement recommandé d’améliorer l’accès à la morphine administrée par voie orale pour soulager les douleurs modérées et aigues causées par le cancer, dont souffrent plus de 80 % des patients en phase terminale.
En 2017, l’Assemblée mondiale de la Santé a adopté la résolution WHA70.12 sur la « Lutte contre le cancer dans le cadre d’une approche intégrée », invitant instamment les États membres et l’OMS à accélérer leur action pour atteindre les objectifs définis dans le Plan d’action mondial pour la lutte contre les maladies non transmissibles 2013-2020 et le Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030 de l’ONU, en vue de réduire le taux de mortalité prématurée due au cancer.

==================================================
«Cáncer» es un término genérico utilizado para designar un amplio grupo de enfermedades que pueden afectar a cualquier parte del organismo; también se habla de «tumores malignos» o «neoplasias malignas». Una característica definitoria del cáncer es la multiplicación rápida de células anormales que se extienden más allá de sus límites habituales y pueden invadir partes adyacentes del cuerpo o propagarse a otros órganos, en un proceso que se denomina «metástasis». La extensión de las metástasis es la principal causa de muerte por la enfermedad.
Dimensión del problema
El cáncer es la principal causa de muerte en todo el mundo: en 2020 se atribuyeron a esta enfermedad casi 10 millones de defunciones (1). Los cánceres más comunes en 2020, por lo que se refiere a los nuevos casos, fueron los siguientes:
Los tipos de cáncer que causaron un mayor número de fallecimientos en 2020 fueron los siguientes:
Cada año, cerca de 400 000 niños contraen cáncer. Aunque los tipos de cáncer más frecuentes varían en función del país, el de cuello uterino es el más habitual en 23 países.
El cáncer se produce cuando células normales se transforman en células tumorales a través de un proceso en varias etapas que suele consistir en la progresión de una lesión precancerosa a un tumor maligno. Esas alteraciones son el resultado de la interacción entre factores genéticos de la persona afectada y tres categorías de agentes externos, a saber:
El Centro Internacional de Investigaciones sobre el Cáncer (CIIC) es un órgano especializado de la OMS que mantiene una clasificación de los agentes cancerígenos.
La incidencia del cáncer aumenta muchísimo con la edad, muy probablemente porque se van acumulando factores de riesgo de determinados tipos de cáncer. A esta acumulación global se suma la pérdida de eficacia de los mecanismos de reparación celular que suele ocurrir con la edad.
Factores de riesgo de cáncer
El consumo de tabaco y de alcohol, una alimentación poco saludable, la inactividad física y la contaminación del aire son factores de riesgo de cáncer y de otras enfermedades no transmisibles.
Además, también lo son algunas infecciones crónicas, sobre todo en los países de ingreso bajo y mediano. Cerca del 13% de los casos de cáncer diagnosticados en el mundo en 2018 se atribuyeron a infecciones carcinógenas, especialmente las causadas por Helicobacter pylori, los papilomavirus humanos, los virus de la hepatitis B y de la hepatitis C y el virus de Epstein-Barr (2).
Los virus de las hepatitis B y C y algunos tipos de papilomavirus humanos aumentan el riesgo de contraer cáncer de hígado y cáncer de cuello uterino, respectivamente, mientras que la infección por el VIH multiplica por seis el riesgo de contraer un cáncer de cuello uterino y aumenta sustancialmente el de otros tipos de cáncer, como el sarcoma de Kaposi.
Reducción de la carga de morbimortalidad por cáncer
En la actualidad se pueden evitar entre el 30% y el 50% de los casos de cáncer reduciendo los factores de riesgo y aplicando estrategias preventivas basadas en la evidencia. Además, esta carga se puede reducir mediante la detección precoz y la atención y el tratamiento adecuados de los pacientes. Si se diagnostican a tiempo y se tratan adecuadamente, las probabilidades de curación de muchos tipos de cáncer son elevadas.
El riesgo de cáncer puede reducirse:
La mortalidad por cáncer se puede reducir si se detecta y se trata a tiempo. La detección precoz tiene dos componentes: el diagnóstico precoz y el tamizaje (cribado).
Cuando el cáncer se detecta en una fase temprana es más probable que responda al tratamiento, lo que podría aumentar las probabilidades de supervivencia, reducir la morbilidad y abaratar la terapia. Si la enfermedad se detecta pronto y no se retrasa la atención se puede mejorar significativamente la vida de los enfermos oncológicos.
El diagnóstico precoz consta de tres componentes:
El diagnóstico precoz de los cánceres sintomáticos se puede y se debe hacer en todas las situaciones para la mayoría de los tipos de cáncer. Los programas oncológicos deben diseñarse para reducir los retrasos y los obstáculos al acceso a los servicios de diagnóstico, tratamiento y atención.
La finalidad del tamizaje es detectar indicios de un cáncer concreto o una determinada lesión precancerosa en personas asintomáticas. Cuando se encuentran anomalías durante el tamizaje deben realizarse más pruebas para confirmar o descartar el diagnóstico y para derivar al paciente a tratamiento, si es necesario.
Los programas de tamizaje son eficaces para algunos tipos de cáncer, pero no para todos, y en general son mucho más complejos y requieren muchos más recursos que el diagnóstico precoz, ya que se precisa usar equipos especiales y dedicar personal específico. Incluso cuando se aplican programas de tamizaje, se siguen necesitando programas de diagnóstico precoz para detectar el cáncer en las personas que no cumplen los criterios de edad o no presentan los factores de riesgo establecidos.
La selección de las personas que se incluyen en los programas de tamizaje se basa en la existencia de factores de riesgo y en la edad, a fin de evitar la realización de demasiados estudios que conduzcan a un exceso de falsos positivos. Estos son algunos ejemplos de métodos de tamizaje:
Tanto el diagnóstico precoz como los programas de tamizaje deben acompañarse de un control de su calidad.
Para tratar de forma adecuada y eficaz un cáncer es fundamental acertar con el diagnóstico, ya que cada tipo de cáncer requiere un tratamiento concreto. Algunos tratamientos utilizados son las intervenciones quirúrgicas, la radioterapia y la terapia sistémica (quimioterapia, tratamientos hormonales, tratamientos biológicos dirigidos). Para seleccionar la pauta terapéutica correcta se deben tener en cuenta tanto el tipo de cáncer como el enfermo. La finalización del protocolo de tratamiento en un periodo definido es importante para lograr el resultado terapéutico previsto.
Un primer paso importante consiste en determinar los objetivos del tratamiento. El objetivo principal suele ser curar el cáncer o prolongar de forma significativa la vida del paciente. Otra meta importante es mejorar la calidad de vida del enfermo ayudándole a tener un bienestar físico, psicosocial y espiritual adecuados y mediante cuidados paliativos en las fases terminales.
Algunos de los cánceres más frecuentes, como el de mama, el de cuello uterino, el bucal o el colorrectal, tienen unas elevadas probabilidades de curación cuando se detectan de forma temprana y se tratan de acuerdo con las prácticas óptimas.
También se logran altas tasas de curación de otros tipos de cáncer, como el seminoma y distintos tipos de leucemias y linfomas infantiles, si se proporciona un tratamiento adecuado, incluso cuando hay células cancerosas en otras zonas del cuerpo.
Sin embargo, se observan variaciones significativas en la disponibilidad de tratamiento entre los países en función de su nivel de ingresos. Según diversos informes, más del 90% de los países de ingreso alto ofrecen un tratamiento integral del cáncer, mientras que en los países de ingreso bajo esta proporción es inferior al 15%.
La finalidad de los cuidados paliativos no es curar el cáncer, sino aliviar los síntomas que causa y mejorar la calidad de vida de los pacientes y de sus familias. Los cuidados paliativos pueden ayudar a vivir con más comodidad y se necesitan especialmente en los lugares donde una proporción elevada de los pacientes están en etapas avanzadas de la enfermedad y tienen pocas posibilidades de curación.
En más del 90% de los enfermos que se encuentran en esas etapas, los cuidados paliativos permiten aliviar los problemas físicos, psicosociales y espirituales.
Las estrategias eficaces de salud pública, que abarcan la atención comunitaria y domiciliaria, son esenciales para ofrecer servicios de cuidados paliativos y de alivio del dolor a los pacientes y sus familias.
Se recomienda encarecidamente mejorar el acceso al tratamiento oral con morfina para aliviar el dolor moderado o intenso causado por el cáncer, que aqueja a más del 80% de los enfermos oncológicos en fase terminal (3).
En 2017, la Asamblea Mundial de la Salud aprobó la resolución WHA70.12 sobre la prevención y el control del cáncer en el contexto de un enfoque integrado, en la que se insta a los Estados Miembros y a la OMS a acelerar la aplicación de medidas encaminadas a alcanzar las metas detalladas en el Plan de Acción Mundial para la Prevención y el Control de las Enfermedades No Transmisibles 2013-2030 y la Agenda 2030 de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo Sostenible a fin de reducir la mortalidad prematura por cáncer.
La OMS y el CIIC colaboran con otras organizaciones del sistema de las Naciones Unidas, como el Organismo Internacional de Energía Atómica, y con sus asociados con estos objetivos:
