==================================================
December 6, 2024 at 1:00 pm
From monitoring Mercury to launching a new adventure to an icy moon of Jupiter, spacecraft and astronauts made great strides in 2024. Here are some of the highlights of this year in space.
The moon has been a hot destination for space agencies and private companies in recent years, and 2024 was no exception.
In January, the Japanese SLIM spacecraft made a successful but lopsided precision landing on a crater’s rim, marking the country’s first soft landing on the moon. The solar-powered Smart Lander for Investigating the Moon was designed to collect data for one lunar day, or about two weeks on Earth, before night fell and it got too dark and cold to survive. But SLIM surprised everyone by sending signals to Earth for three months.
SLIM was joined by another unintentionally sideways lander in February. Odysseus, a spacecraft built by Houston-based company Intuitive Machines, touched down and toppled over near the lunar south pole. During its six-day mission, the probe sent back data that may be instructive for NASA’s Artemis mission, which aims to land humans on the moon in 2026 (SN: 3/23/24, p. 16).
Finally, China’s Chang’e 6 spacecraft grabbed the first samples from the farside of the moon in June (SN: 6/29/24, p. 12). The first look at the samples revealed soil that’s fluffier than soil from the nearside. A chemical analysis of the samples, reported in Nature, suggests the farside was volcanically active some 2.8 billion years ago (SN: 11/15/24).
Meanwhile, the Chang’e 6 orbiter turned up at a spot orbiting the sun called L2, the same region of space that is occupied by the James Webb Space Telescope. It’s not clear yet what the Chinese space agency plans to do with it there.
2024 opened with a farewell to a beloved Mars explorer. NASA’s Ingenuity, nicknamed Ginny, was the first helicopter to operate on the Red Planet. The craft was supposed to fly a few times over the course of 30 days; instead, it took 72 flights over almost three years. The airborne explorer was finally grounded in January after its rotor blades were damaged (SN: 1/25/24).
Ingenuity’s companion, the Perseverance rover, made perhaps its most important discovery yet in July: a rock containing hints of ancient microbes (SN: 8/24/24, p. 6). But the discovery came against a backdrop of uncertainty: The budget for NASA’s planned Mars Sample Return mission is in jeopardy (SN: 6/15/24, p. 12), which means the intriguing bit of rock might not make it back to Earth for further study.
Private spaceflight highs and lows
Four years after SpaceX became the first private company to launch astronauts to the International Space Station, the company supported another commercial milestone: the first all-civilian spacewalk (SN: 5/27/20). The Polaris Dawn mission launched four astronauts to the space station in September. The crew tested new SpaceX spacesuits and collected data on radiation and the astronauts’ physiology. One member of the crew, Sarah Gillis, also became the first person to play the violin in space.
Another private company had a rougher time of it. Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft launched astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore to the space station in early June for an eight-day mission, but problems with the spacecraft’s thrusters delayed the astronauts’ return. Starliner returned to Earth in September without its crew. Williams and Wilmore will remain on the space station until February, when a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft will bring them home.
End of an asteroid hunting era
Earth lost a planetary protector this year. In August, NASA said goodnight to the NEOWISE telescope after it spent more than a decade scanning the sky for threatening asteroids.
NEOWISE launched in 2009 on a mission to study infrared light from distant cosmic objects (SN: 12/10/09). When the telescope ran out of coolant, scientists repurposed it to observe asteroids that come close to Earth, which also emit infrared light thanks to heat from the sun.
Over its lifetime, NEOWISE observed thousands of asteroids and hundreds of comets, giving scientists a more precise sense of the dangers these space rocks pose to Earth. The telescope’s loss leaves us somewhat in the dark, but fortunately not for too long. Another asteroid hunter, NEO Surveyor, is slated to launch no earlier than 2027.
The BepiColombo spacecraft made a close flyby of Mercury on September 4, getting its first view of the planet’s south pole.
The joint European and Japanese probe took off for Mercury in October 2018, and it still has about two years to go until it arrives. Because Mercury is so close to the sun and its gravitational might, it’s not easy to maneuver a spacecraft into orbit around the tiny planet. BepiColombo is making close passes of Mercury and using the planet’s gravity to nudge it on course to enter orbit in November 2026.
One flyby this year gave the spacecraft views of Mercury it won’t have even when it is in orbit. BepiColombo approached from Mercury’s night side, so the planet’s crater rims cast deep shadows that could reveal new details about their topography.
The next flyby will be on January 8.
NASA’s Europa Clipper spacecraft launched on October 14, bound for an icy moon of Jupiter that may have the conditions for life to exist (SN: 10/8/24). Because Europa hosts a liquid water ocean under a thick shell of ice, it is among the top contenders for extraterrestrial life in the solar system.
Once Clipper arrives at Jupiter in 2030, the spacecraft will make nearly 50 flybys of the moon to study its subsurface ocean. Clipper won’t orbit Europa directly because of Jupiter’s intense magnetic field, which traps high amounts of technology-disrupting radiation in the moon’s vicinity. Instead, Clipper will dip in and out of this radiation field to avoid prolonged exposure, taking data and then backing off to recover before diving back in.

==================================================

August 1, 2025 at 11:00 am
The James Webb Space Telescope has taken its first look at black holes secretly snacking on stars within dusty galaxies. JWST’s ability to pick up detailed infrared signals lets it peer past the dust to probe the mostly hidden black holes, researchers report in the Aug. 1 Astrophysical Journal Letters.
A dormant black hole is normally impossible to see. That changes when a star wanders too close. The black hole’s gravity stretches the star into a disk that rotates around and feeds the temporarily awakened giant in a tidal disruption event, or TDE. The disk of star gas heats up and emits X-rays and ultraviolet and visible light, which is how astronomers typically find sleepy black holes.
But “these wavelengths can be basically blocked” if dust shrouds a feasting black hole, says MIT astrophysicist Megan Masterson. Most known TDEs took place in fairly clear environments, but the events probably happen just as often in dusty, obscured galaxies, she and her colleagues recently reported. They’re just harder to see.
That dust, however, gives off its own signals. It releases infrared light after absorbing the gas’s emissions in other wavelengths. In previous work, Masterson and colleagues searched archived data from an infrared-based space survey and spotted 12 probable TDEs.
Masterson and colleagues set JWST’s sights on four of those TDEs. JWST, which sees in a wider range of infrared wavelengths than previous telescopes, detected infrared emissions from atoms that had been stripped of electrons through strong X-ray and ultraviolet radiation. That’s a telltale sign of a dining black hole.
Bright gas disks around fully awake black holes, which feed constantly and are surrounded by dust clumps, could give off similar radiation. But the observed signs of silicate dust looked more like specks swirling around a dormant black hole briefly waking up for a stellar snack, the team found. Computer simulations confirmed that TDEs could explain what JWST saw.
Infrared light emissions are delayed by a few months compared with the typically detected wavelengths because it takes time for the shredded star’s light to reach the dust. But they’re essentially the only way to study feasting black holes blanketed by dust, Masterson says.

==================================================
July 30, 2025 at 9:00 am
A quantum computer has reached new heights.
The first quantum computer in space is now orbiting Earth on a satellite, scientists report. Launched on June 23, the computer had to be designed to fit in a small package, use limited power and endure wild temperature swings.
The computer’s hardware is now operational, says project leader Philip Walther, a physicist at the University of Vienna. Demonstrations of its capabilities are coming next.
Satellites often contain onboard computers that perform various calculations. For example, a satellite might process and enhance images on the fly. Crunching the numbers in space and sending the result down to the ground is often more efficient than beaming back all the raw data.
But energy is at a premium on satellites. That means quantum computers could be useful if they can perform such calculations more efficiently than standard computers. Because quantum computers use the physics of the small scale realm, they may be better at solving particular problems, such as certain machine learning tasks.
The device is a photonic quantum computer, meaning it calculates using particles of light called photons. Such computers are typically built in highly controlled laboratory conditions and sprawl across tables that are meters long, using energy-hungry lasers and electronics. The new quantum computer fills a volume of just 3 liters and uses only about 10 watts of power — similar to a typical LED light bulb.
Scientists have previously deployed satellites designed for quantum communication. Those satellites can transmit and receive photons to enable ultrasecure messaging across large distances. In the future, such quantum communication networks may also demand quantum computers in orbit, Walther says.
Space-based quantum computers could also allow tests of fundamental physics principles in a new environment, Walther says. “Being the first here also means we have the duty and privilege to investigate if things operate in the way as we’d be used to on the ground.”

All Stories by Lisa Grossman
A Soviet spacecraft has returned to Earth
Kosmos 482 launched for Venus in 1972 but never left Earth orbit. The spacecraft finally lost enough energy that it couldn't fight gravity anymore.
A claimed hint of alien life whips up spirited debate
Astronomers have a lot of thoughts about the latest paper claiming we’ve found the strongest hints of alien life yet on the distant planet K2 18b.
A NASA rover finally found Mars’ missing carbon
The Curiosity rover identified hidden caches of the mineral siderite, which could help explain why Mars lost its habitable climate.
Check out some of the weird rocks that have turned up on Mars
Some of the unusual rocks carry stories about water on Mars. One has hints of long-gone microbes. All tell of a dynamic, complex planet.
JWST spots the earliest sign yet of a distant galaxy reshaping its cosmic environs
The galaxy, called JADES-GS-z13-1, marks the earliest sign yet spotted of the era of cosmic reionization at 330 million years after the Big Bang.
The nearest single star to Earth has four small planets
Last year, astronomers announced that a planet orbits Barnard’s star. Now, researchers have confirmed the existence of three more.
New baby pictures of the universe deepen a cosmic mystery
Cosmic microwave background data support cosmology’s standard model but retain a mystery about the universe’s expansion rate.
The Blue Ghost lander just witnessed a lunar eclipse — from the moon
The privately-owned lander turned its cameras toward Earth as our planet cast its shadow over the moon. It’s not the first spacecraft to do so.
Two privately-owned spacecraft make contact from the moon
Firefly Aerospace landed a craft safely last week, a first for a private company. But Intuitive Machines’ mission ended when its lander wound up on its side in a crater.
The Milky Way’s black hole is constantly bubbling
The disc of plasma surrounding the black hole at the heart of the Milky Way is constantly emitting flares both large and small.
A private mission to Venus aims to look for signs of life
If successful, Morning Star would be the first private mission to another planet and the first in over 30 years to directly measure Venus’s clouds.
Earth had new, temporary radiation rings last year
Two bands of radiation called the Van Allen belts encircle Earth. After a May 2024 solar superstorm, two more showed up between those belts.
