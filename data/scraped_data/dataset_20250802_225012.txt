Introduction to Blockchain Technology
Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that functions as a shared, immutable digital ledger. The name "blockchain" comes from its structure data is organized in blocks, with each new block linked to the one before it, forming a continuous chain.
Each block contains crucial data, such as a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a unique identifier called a cryptographic hash. This hash is generated from the block's contents and the hash of the previous block, ensuring that each block is tightly connected to the one before it.
Blockchain is decentralized and distributed, meaning no single authority controls it. Instead, multiple computers (nodes) on a network each have a copy of the blockchain, keeping the ledger synchronized. This setup ensures that once data, like a transaction, is recorded and confirmed, it becomes immutable almost impossible to alter or delete
How does Blockchain Technology Work?
One of the famous use of Blockchain is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and is used to exchange digital assets online. Bitcoin uses cryptographic proof instead of third-party trust for two parties to execute transactions over the Internet. Each transaction protects through a digital signature.
Blockchain Decentralization
There is no Central Server or System which keeps the data of the Blockchain. The data is distributed over Millions of Computers around the world which are connected to the Blockchain. This system allows the Notarization of Data as it is present on every Node and is publicly verifiable.
A node is a computer connected to the Blockchain Network. Node gets connected with Blockchain using the client. The client helps in validating and propagating transactions onto the Blockchain. When a computer connects to the Blockchain, a copy of the Blockchain data gets downloaded into the system and the node comes in sync with the latest block of data on Blockchain. The Node connected to the Blockchain which helps in the execution of a Transaction in return for an incentive is called Miners.
Disadvantages of the current transaction system:
Building trust with Blockchain: Blockchain enhances trust across a business network. It's not that you can't trust those who you conduct business with it's that you don't need to when operating on a Blockchain network. Blockchain builds trust through the following five attributes:
Key Components of Blockchain
Blockchain technology relies on a few fundamental components and concepts that work together to achieve its functionality:
History and Evolution of Blockchain
In 1982 Cryptographer David Chaum proposed a protocol, that resembles blockchain elements, aiming to secure information among network participants. In the early 1990s, Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta created the first prototype of a cryptographically secured chain of blocks, using hashing to time-stamp documents to prevent tampering. This led to the development of Merkle trees in 1992, improving efficiency.
Bitcoin was created in 2008 when an unknown entity published a white paper, using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin introduced a decentralized, public blockchain that solved the double-spending problem in digital money, allowing secure transactions without relying on banks or governments.
In 2015, Vitalik Buterin launched Ethereum, which expanded blockchain’s capabilities beyond cryptocurrency by introducing smart contracts. This marked the shift to Blockchain 2.0, where developers could build decentralized applications (DApps) on the blockchain.
Application of Blockchain
Is Blockchain Secure?
Nowadays, as the blockchain industry is increasing day by day, a question arises is Blockchain safe? or how safe is blockchain? As we know after a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, previous blocks cannot be changed. If a change in data is tried to be made then it keeps on changing the Hash blocks, but with this change, there will be a rejection as there are no similarities with the previous block.
Just imagine there is a  who hacker runs a node on a blockchain network, he wants to alter a blockchain and steal cryptocurrency from everyone else. With a change in the copy, they would have to convince the other nodes that their copy was valid.
They would need to control a majority of the network to do this and insert it at just the right moment. This is known as a 51% attack because you need to control more than 50% of the network to attempt it.
Timing would be everything in this type of attack—by the time the hacker takes any action, the network is likely to have moved past the blocks they were trying to alter.
Blockchain project ideas
Here are a few project ideas for beginners looking to learn more about blockchain technology:
These are just a few examples, there are many other possibilities to explore within Blockchain technology.
Future Scope of Blockchain Technology
Finance, supply chain management, and the Internet of Things are just a few of the sectors that blockchain technology has the power to upend (IoT). The following are some potential uses for blockchain in the future:
In general, blockchain technology is still in its early stages and has a wide range of potential applications.
Advantages of Blockchain Technology:
Disadvantages of Blockchain Technology:
- Blockchain's linked structure makes data tampering detectable by altering hashes and breaking the chain.
- It acts as a distributed database, storing transactions across the network.
- Each transaction is verified by the majority, ensuring legitimacy.
- This decentralization prevents any single party from manipulating the data.
- Cash can only be used in low-amount transactions locally.
- The huge waiting time in the processing of transactions.
- The need for a third party for verification and execution of Transactions makes the process complex.
- If the Central Server like Banks is compromised, the whole system is affected including the participants.
- Organizations doing validation charge high process thus making the process expensive.
- Distributed: The distributed ledger is shared and updated with every incoming transaction among the nodes connected to the Blockchain. All this is done in real time as there is no central server controlling the data.
- Secure: There is no unauthorized access to Blockchain made possible through Permissions and Cryptography.
- Transparent: Because every node or participant in Blockchain has a copy of the Blockchain data, they have access to all transaction data. They themselves can verify the identities without the need for mediators.
- Consensus-based: All relevant network participants must agree that a transaction is valid. This is achieved through the use of consensus algorithms.
- Flexible: Smart Contracts which are executed based on certain conditions can be written into the platform. Blockchain Networks can evolve in pace with business processes.
- Distributed Ledger: Blockchain is a shared record system spread across many computers, with each participant having a copy. Once data is added, it can't be changed or deleted, ensuring no single point of failure or control.
- Blocks: Data is stored in blocks, each containing a set of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference (hash) to the previous block. This creates a secure, linked chain of blocks, where any change would disrupt the chain.
- Nodes (Peer-to-Peer Network): Nodes are the devices in the network that store the blockchain and validate new transactions. They communicate directly, ensuring the blockchain remains decentralized and operates without a central authority.
- Cryptography (Hashes & Signatures): Blockchain uses cryptography to secure data. Each block’s unique hash acts as a tamper-proof seal, and public/private key pairs verify the authenticity of transactions, ensuring data integrity and privacy.
- Consensus Mechanism: Nodes agree on the blockchain’s state using consensus algorithms (e.g., Proof of Work or Proof of Stake). This prevents fraud by ensuring that the majority of the network agrees on each new block.
- Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are automated scripts on the blockchain that execute actions when specific conditions are met. They help automate complex processes like payments and agreements, without the need for intermediaries, providing transparency and security.
- Leading Investment Banking Companies like Credit Suisse, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup have invested in Blockchain and are experimenting to improve the banking experience and secure it.
- Following the Banking Sector, the Accountants are following the same path. Accountancy involves extensive data, including financial statements spreadsheets containing lots of personal and institutional data. Therefore, accounting can be layered with blockchain to easily track confidential and sensitive data and reduce human error and fraud. Industry Experts from Deloitte, PwC, KPMG, and EY are proficiently working and using blockchain-based software.
- Booking a Flight requires sensitive data ranging from the passenger's name, credit card numbers, immigration details, identification, destinations, and sometimes even accommodation and travel information. So sensitive data can be secured using blockchain technology. Russian Airlines are working towards the same.
- Various industries, including hotel services, pay a significant amount ranging from 18-22% of their revenue to third-party agencies. Using blockchain, the involvement of the middleman is cut short and allows interaction directly with the consumer ensuring benefits to both parties. Winding Tree works extensively with Lufthansa, AirFrance, AirCanada, and Etihad Airways to cut short third-party operators charging high fees.
- Barclays uses Blockchain to streamline the Know Your Customer (KYC) and Fund Transfer processes while filling patents against these features.
- Visa uses Blockchain to deal with business-to-business payment services.
- Unilever uses Blockchain to track all their transactions in the supply chain and maintain the product's quality at every stage of the process.
- Walmart has been using Blockchain Technology for quite some time to keep track of their food items coming right from farmers to the customer. They let the customer check the product’s history right from its origin.
- DHL and Accenture work together to track the origin of medicine until it reaches the consumer.
- Pfizer, an industry leader, has developed a blockchain system to keep track of and manage the inventory of medicines.
- The government of Dubai looking forward to making Dubai the first-ever city to rely on entirely and work using blockchain, even in their government office.
- Along with the above organizations, leading tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Facebook, TCS, Oracle, Samsung, NVIDIA, Accenture, and PayPal, are working on Blockchain extensively
- Cryptocurrency Wallet: Create a simple cryptocurrency wallet application that allows users to send and receive digital assets.
- Blockchain Explorer: Develop a web-based application that allows users to view and search the transactions on a specific blockchain.
- Smart Contract: Implement a simple smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain that can be used to manage a digital token or asset.
- Voting System: Create a blockchain-based voting system that allows for secure and transparent voting while maintaining voter anonymity.
- Supply Chain Management: Develop a blockchain-based system for tracking the movement of goods and services through a supply chain, providing greater transparency and traceability.
- Decentralized marketplace: Create a decentralized marketplace using blockchain technology where the goods and services can be directly bought by the customers without any intermediary.
- Identity Management: Create a decentralized digital identity management system that allows users to control their personal information and share it securely with others.
- Digital Identity: Blockchain-based digital IDs might be used to store personal data safely and securely as well as offer a means of establishing identity without the need for a central authority.
- Smart Contracts: A variety of legal and financial transactions could be automated using smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement put straight into lines of code.
- Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Using blockchain technology, decentralized financial systems might be built that support peer-to-peer transactions and do away with conventional intermediaries like banks.
- Supply Chain Management: Blockchain technology can be applied to a permanent record of how goods and services have been moved, enabling improved openness and traceability across the whole supply chain.-Internet of Things (IoT): Blockchain technology may be used to build decentralized, secure networks for IoT devices, enabling them to exchange data and communicate with one another in an anonymous, safe manner.
- Decentralization: The decentralized nature of blockchain technology eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing transparency.
- Security: Transactions on a blockchain are secured through cryptography, making them virtually immune to hacking and fraud.
- Transparency: Blockchain technology allows all parties in a transaction to have access to the same information, increasing transparency and reducing the potential for disputes.
- Efficiency: Transactions on a blockchain can be processed quickly and efficiently, reducing the time and cost associated with traditional transactions.
- Trust: The transparent and secure nature of blockchain technology can help to build trust between parties in a transaction.
- Scalability: The decentralized nature of blockchain technology can make it difficult to scale for large-scale applications.
- Energy Consumption: The process of mining blockchain transactions requires significant amounts of computing power, which can lead to high energy consumption and environmental concerns.
- Adoption: While the potential applications of blockchain technology are vast, adoption has been slow due to the technical complexity and lack of understanding of the technology.
- Regulation: The regulatory framework around blockchain technology is still in its early stages, which can create uncertainty for businesses and investors.
- Lack of Standards: The lack of standardized protocols and technologies can make it difficult for businesses to integrate blockchain technology into their existing systems.
- Overall, the advantages of blockchain technology are significant and have the potential to revolutionize many industries. However, there are also several challenges and disadvantages that must be addressed before the technology can reach its full potential.

==================================================
The blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are resistant to alteration because, once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be changed retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks and obtaining network consensus to accept these changes.
Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]
A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.[6] The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need for a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.[7]
Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil";[8] however, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless ones.[4][9]
Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups".[10][11] Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][12] They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.[4][13] Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.[14]
The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[3]
In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[15] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.[16]
The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.[17]
According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters' phase.[18] Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.
In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term "planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain".[19] For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a 'game-changer' for their business.[20]
A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.[3][21] This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[22] A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[23] Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol.[24] A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.[citation needed]
Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:[25]
Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.[3] Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.[3] This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the initial block, which is known as the genesis block (Block 0).[27] To assure the integrity of a block and the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.[28]
Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.[27] Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially[29] as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.[3][30]: ch. 08 [31] For example, bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and parallel manner.[32]
The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.[33]
A hard fork is a change to the blockchain protocol that is not backward compatible and requires all users to upgrade their software in order to continue participating in the network. In a hard fork, the network splits into two separate versions: one that follows the new rules and one that follows the old rules.
For example, Ethereum was hard forked in 2016 to "make whole" the investors in The DAO, which had been hacked by exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.[34]
By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates some risks that come with data being held centrally.[3] The decentralized blockchain may use ad hoc message passing and distributed networking.[37]
In a so-called "51% attack" a central entity gains control of more than half of a network and can then manipulate that specific blockchain record at will, allowing double-spending.[38]
Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography.[39]: 5  A public key (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.[3]
Every node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. Data quality is maintained by massive database replication[40] and computational trust. No centralized "official" copy exists and no user is "trusted" more than any other.[39] Transactions are broadcast to the network using the software. Messages are delivered on a best-effort basis. Early blockchains rely on energy-intensive mining nodes to validate transactions,[27] add them to the block they are building, and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes.[30]: ch. 08  Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as proof-of-work, to serialize changes.[41] Later consensus methods include proof of stake.[27] The growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of centralization because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive.[42]
Finality is the level of confidence that the well-formed block recently appended to the blockchain will not be revoked in the future (is "finalized") and thus can be trusted. Most distributed blockchain protocols, whether proof of work or proof of stake, cannot guarantee the finality of a freshly committed block, and instead rely on "probabilistic finality": as the block goes deeper into a blockchain, it is less likely to be altered or reverted by a newly found consensus.[43]
Byzantine fault tolerance-based proof-of-stake protocols purport to provide so called "absolute finality": a randomly chosen validator proposes a block, the rest of validators vote on it, and, if a supermajority decision approves it, the block is irreversibly committed into the blockchain.[43] A modification of this method, an "economic finality", is used in practical protocols, like the Casper protocol used in Ethereum: validators which sign two different blocks at the same position in the blockchain are subject to "slashing", where their leveraged stake is forfeited.[43]
Open blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.[44][45][46][47][48] Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term "blockchain" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases.[49] Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.[50]: 30–31  Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.[44][46] Nikolai Hampton of Computerworld said that "many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases," and "without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion."[8][51]
Permissionless (public) blockchain
An advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no access control is needed.[29] This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a transport layer.[29]
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles. While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by Adam Back, the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".
In 2016, venture capital investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the US but increasing in China.[52] Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. As of April 2018[update], bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.
Permissioned (private) blockchain
Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.[53] It has been argued that permissioned blockchains can guarantee a certain level of decentralization, if carefully designed, as opposed to permissionless blockchains, which are often centralized in practice.[9]
Disadvantages of permissioned blockchain
Nikolai Hampton argued in Computerworld that "There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished."[8] This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a financial crisis or debt crisis such as the 2008 financial crisis, where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others,[54] and "the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power — it's time-consuming and expensive."[8] He also said, "Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors. This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases."[8]
The analysis of public blockchains has become increasingly important with the popularity of bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies.[55] A blockchain, if it is public, provides access to anyone to observe and analyse the chain data, given the know-how.  The process of understanding and accessing the flow of crypto has been an issue for many cryptocurrencies, crypto exchanges and banks.[56][57]  The reason for this is accusations of blockchain-enabled cryptocurrencies enabling illicit dark market trading of drugs, weapons, money laundering, etc.[58] A common belief has been that cryptocurrency is private and untraceable, thus leading many actors to use it for illegal purposes. This is changing now that specialised tech companies provide blockchain tracking services, making crypto exchanges, law-enforcement and banks more aware of what is happening with crypto funds and fiat-crypto exchanges. The development, some argue, has led criminals to prioritise the use of new cryptos such as Monero.[59][60][61]
In April 2016, Standards Australia submitted a proposal to the International Organization for Standardization to consider developing standards to support blockchain technology. This proposal resulted in the creation of ISO Technical Committee 307, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies.[62] The technical committee has working groups relating to blockchain terminology, reference architecture, security and privacy, identity, smart contracts, governance and interoperability for blockchain and DLT, as well as standards specific to industry sectors and generic government requirements.[63][non-primary source needed] More than 50 countries are participating in the standardization process together with external liaisons such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the European Commission, the International Federation of Surveyors, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).[63]
Many other national standards bodies and open standards bodies are also working on blockchain standards.[64] These include the National Institute of Standards and Technology[65] (NIST), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization[66] (CENELEC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers[67] (IEEE), the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), and some individual participants in the Internet Engineering Task Force[68] (IETF).
Centralized blockchain
Although most of blockchain implementation are decentralized and distributed, Oracle launched a centralized blockchain table feature in Oracle 21c database. The Blockchain Table in Oracle 21c database is a centralized blockchain which provide immutable feature. Compared to decentralized blockchains, centralized blockchains normally can provide a higher throughput and lower latency of transactions than consensus-based distributed blockchains.[69][70]
Currently, there are at least four types of blockchain networks — public blockchains, private blockchains, consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains.
A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus protocol).[71][self-published source?] Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a proof-of-stake or proof-of-work algorithm.
Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.
A private blockchain is permissioned.[53] One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted. To distinguish between open blockchains and other peer-to-peer decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters, the terminology Distributed Ledger (DLT) is normally used for private blockchains.
A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features.[72] The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization and decentralization are used.
A sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary blockchain.[73][74] Entries from the primary blockchain (where said entries typically represent digital assets) can be linked to and from the sidechain; this allows the sidechain to otherwise operate independently of the primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means of record keeping, alternate consensus algorithm, etc.).[75][better source needed]
Consortium blockchain
A consortium blockchain is a type of blockchain that combines elements of both public and private blockchains. In a consortium blockchain, a group of organizations come together to create and operate the blockchain, rather than a single entity. The consortium members jointly manage the blockchain network and are responsible for validating transactions. Consortium blockchains are permissioned, meaning that only certain individuals or organizations are allowed to participate in the network. This allows for greater control over who can access the blockchain and helps to ensure that sensitive information is kept confidential.
Consortium blockchains are commonly used in industries where multiple organizations need to collaborate on a common goal, such as supply chain management or financial services. One advantage of consortium blockchains is that they can be more efficient and scalable than public blockchains, as the number of nodes required to validate transactions is typically smaller. Additionally, consortium blockchains can provide greater security and reliability than private blockchains, as the consortium members work together to maintain the network. Some examples of consortium blockchains include Quorum and Hyperledger.[76]
Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin; there were also a few other operational products that had matured from proof of concept by late 2016.[52] As of 2016, some businesses have been testing the technology and conducting low-level implementation to gauge blockchain's effects on organizational efficiency in their back office.[77]
Blockchain is seen as a pivotal technological advancement of the 21st century, with the ability to impact organizations at strategic, operational, and market levels.[78] In 2019, it was estimated that around $2.9 billion were invested in blockchain technology, which represents an 89% increase from the year prior. Additionally, the International Data Corp estimated that corporate investment into blockchain technology would reach $12.4 billion by 2022.[79] Furthermore, According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the second-largest professional services network in the world, blockchain technology has the potential to generate an annual business value of more than $3 trillion by 2030. PwC's estimate is further augmented by a 2018 study that they have conducted, in which PwC surveyed 600 business executives and determined that 84% have at least some exposure to utilizing blockchain technology, which indicates a significant demand and interest in blockchain technology.[80]
In 2019, the BBC World Service radio and podcast series Fifty Things That Made the Modern Economy identified blockchain as a technology that would have far-reaching consequences for economics and society. The economist and Financial Times journalist and broadcaster Tim Harford discussed why the underlying technology might have much wider applications and the challenges that needed to be overcome.[81] His first broadcast was on 29 June 2019.
The number of blockchain wallets quadrupled to 40 million between 2016 and 2020.[82]
A paper published in 2022 discussed the potential use of blockchain technology in sustainable management.[83]
Most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency, placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation.[84] Compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand, cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement.[84]
The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain. A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.[84][85] Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block,[85] a timestamp and transaction data.[86] By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".[85] For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.
Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain.[87]
In the context of cryptocurrencies, the blockchain serves as a public ledger for all transactions. Cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to "prove the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party".[84]
The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was first released as open-source software in 2009.
As cryptocurrencies have gained prominence, several countries have made advancements in their private and commercial law treatment to address legal uncertainties. In the United States, for example, the 2022 amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) introduced Article 12, which establishes "controllable electronic records" (CERs) as a new category of personal property. This framework provides legal clarity for the ownership, transfer, and use of cryptocurrencies as CERs, with the concept of "control" serving as a functional equivalent to possession for digital assets. These reforms aim to align legal standards with market practices, reducing title disputes and supporting the integration of cryptocurrencies into commercial transactions.[88]
Blockchain-based smart contracts are contracts that can be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction.[89] One of the main objectives of a smart contract is automated escrow. A key feature of smart contracts is that they do not need a trusted third party (such as a trustee) to act as an intermediary between contracting entities — the blockchain network executes the contract on its own. This may reduce friction between entities when transferring value and could subsequently open the door to a higher level of transaction automation.[90] An IMF staff discussion from 2018 reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce moral hazards and optimize the use of contracts in general, but "no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged." Due to the lack of widespread use, their legal status was unclear.[91][92]
According to Reason, many banks have expressed interest in implementing distributed ledgers for use in banking and are cooperating with companies creating private blockchains;[93][94][95] according to a September 2016 IBM study, it is occurring faster than expected.[96] It has been estimated by the World Economic Forum that by 2025, 10% of the world's GDP will be stored on blockchain related technology.[78]
Banks are interested in this technology not least because it has the potential to speed up back office settlement systems.[97] Moreover, as the blockchain industry has reached early maturity institutional appreciation has grown that it is, practically speaking, the infrastructure of a whole new financial industry, with all the implications which that entails.[98] This technology will transform financial transactions due to its ability to enhance data storage, process simultaneous transactions, lessen transaction costs, and improve capital market transparency for debt and equity capital administration.[78]
Banks such as UBS are opening new research labs dedicated to blockchain technology in order to explore how blockchain can be used in financial services to increase efficiency and reduce costs.[99][100]
Berenberg, a German bank, believes that blockchain is an "overhyped technology" that has had a large number of "proofs of concept", but still has major challenges, and very few success stories.[101]
The blockchain has also given rise to initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well as a new category of digital asset called security token offerings (STOs), also sometimes referred to as digital security offerings (DSOs).[102] STO/DSOs may be conducted privately or on public, regulated stock exchange and are used to tokenize traditional assets such as company shares as well as more innovative ones like intellectual property, real estate,[103] art, or individual products. A number of companies are active in this space providing services for compliant tokenization, private STOs, and public STOs.
Blockchain technology, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has been used in video games for monetization. Many live-service games offer in-game customization options, such as character skins or other in-game items, which the players can earn and trade with other players using in-game currency. Some games also allow for trading of virtual items using real-world currency, but this may be illegal in some countries where video games are seen as akin to gambling, and has led to gray market issues such as skin gambling, and thus publishers typically have shied away from allowing players to earn real-world funds from games.[104] Blockchain games typically allow players to trade these in-game items for cryptocurrency, which can then be exchanged for money.[105]
The first known game to use blockchain technologies was CryptoKitties, launched in November 2017, where the player would purchase NFTs with Ethereum cryptocurrency, each NFT consisting of a virtual pet that the player could breed with others to create offspring with combined traits as new NFTs.[106][105] The game made headlines in December 2017 when one virtual pet sold for more than US$100,000.[107] CryptoKitties also illustrated scalability problems for games on Ethereum when it created significant congestion on the Ethereum network in early 2018 with approximately 30% of all Ethereum transactions[clarification needed] being for the game.[108][109]
By the early 2020s, there had not been a breakout success in video games using blockchain, as these games tend to focus on using blockchain for speculation instead of more traditional forms of gameplay, which offers limited appeal to most players. Such games also represent a high risk to investors as their revenues can be difficult to predict.[105] However, limited successes of some games, such as Axie Infinity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and corporate plans towards metaverse content, refueled interest in the area of GameFi, a term describing the intersection of video games and financing typically backed by blockchain currency, in the second half of 2021.[110] Several major publishers, including Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, and Take Two Interactive, have stated that blockchain and NFT-based games are under serious consideration for their companies in the future.[111]
In October 2021, Valve Corporation banned blockchain games, including those using cryptocurrency and NFTs, from being hosted on its Steam digital storefront service, which is widely used for personal computer gaming, claiming that this was an extension of their policy banning games that offered in-game items with real-world value. Valve's prior history with gambling, specifically skin gambling, was speculated to be a factor in the decision to ban blockchain games.[112] Journalists and players responded positively to Valve's decision as blockchain and NFT games have a reputation for scams and fraud among most PC gamers,[104][112] and Epic Games, which runs the Epic Games Store in competition to Steam, said that they would be open to accepted blockchain games in the wake of Valve's refusal.[113]
There have been several different efforts to employ blockchains in supply chain management.
There are several different efforts to offer domain name services via the blockchain. These domain names can be controlled by the use of a private key, which purports to allow for uncensorable websites. This would also bypass a registrar's ability to suppress domains used for fraud, abuse, or illegal content.[121]
Namecoin is a cryptocurrency that supports the ".bit" top-level domain (TLD). Namecoin was forked from bitcoin in 2011. The .bit TLD is not sanctioned by ICANN, instead requiring an alternative DNS root.[121] As of 2015, .bit was used by 28 websites, out of 120,000 registered names.[122] Namecoin was dropped by OpenNIC in 2019, due to malware and potential other legal issues.[123] Other blockchain alternatives to ICANN include The Handshake Network,[122] EmerDNS, and Unstoppable Domains.[121]
Specific TLDs include ".eth", ".luxe", and ".kred", which are associated with the Ethereum blockchain through the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). The .kred TLD also acts as an alternative to conventional cryptocurrency wallet addresses as a convenience for transferring cryptocurrency.[124]
Blockchain technology can be used to create a permanent, public, transparent ledger system for compiling data on sales, tracking digital use and payments to content creators, such as wireless users[125] or musicians.[126] The Gartner 2019 CIO Survey reported 2% of higher education respondents had launched blockchain projects and another 18% were planning academic projects in the next 24 months.[127] In 2017, IBM partnered with ASCAP and PRS for Music to adopt blockchain technology in music distribution.[128] Imogen Heap's Mycelia service has also been proposed as a blockchain-based alternative "that gives artists more control over how their songs and associated data circulate among fans and other musicians."[129][130]
New distribution methods are available for the insurance industry such as peer-to-peer insurance, parametric insurance and microinsurance following the adoption of blockchain.[131][132] The sharing economy and IoT are also set to benefit from blockchains because they involve many collaborating peers.[133] The use of blockchain in libraries is being studied with a grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services.[134]
Other blockchain designs include Hyperledger, a collaborative effort from the Linux Foundation to support blockchain-based distributed ledgers, with projects under this initiative including Hyperledger Burrow (by Monax) and Hyperledger Fabric (spearheaded by IBM).[135][136][137] Another is Quorum, a permissioned private blockchain by JPMorgan Chase with private storage, used for contract applications.[138]
Oracle introduced a blockchain table feature in its Oracle 21c database.[69][70]
Blockchain is also being used in peer-to-peer energy trading.[139][140][141]
Lightweight blockchains, or simplified blockchains, are more suitable for internet of things (IoT) applications than conventional blockchains.[142] One experiment suggested that a lightweight blockchain-based network could accommodate up to 1.34 million authentication processes every second, which could be sufficient for resource-constrained IoT networks.[143]
Blockchain could be used in detecting counterfeits by associating unique identifiers to products, documents and shipments, and storing records associated with transactions that cannot be forged or altered.[144][145] It is however argued that blockchain technology needs to be supplemented with technologies that provide a strong binding between physical objects and blockchain systems,[146] as well as provisions for content creator verification ala KYC standards.[147] The EUIPO established an Anti-Counterfeiting Blockathon Forum, with the objective of "defining, piloting and implementing" an anti-counterfeiting infrastructure at the European level.[148][149] The Dutch Standardisation organisation NEN uses blockchain together with QR Codes to authenticate certificates.[150]
Beijing and Shanghai are among the cities designated by China to trial blockchain applications as January 30, 2022.[151] In Chinese legal proceedings, blockchain technology was first accepted as a method for authenticating internet evidence by the Hangzhou Internet Court in 2019 and has since been accepted by other Chinese courts.[152]: 123–125
Blockchain interoperability
With the increasing number of blockchain systems appearing, even only those that support cryptocurrencies, blockchain interoperability is becoming a topic of major importance. The objective is to support transferring assets from one blockchain system to another blockchain system. Wegner[153] stated that "interoperability is the ability of two or more software components to cooperate despite differences in language, interface, and execution platform". The objective of blockchain interoperability is therefore to support such cooperation among blockchain systems, despite those kinds of differences.
There are already several blockchain interoperability solutions available.[154] They can be classified into three categories: cryptocurrency interoperability approaches, blockchain engines, and blockchain connectors.
Several individual IETF participants produced the draft of a blockchain interoperability architecture.[155]
Energy consumption concerns
Some cryptocurrencies use blockchain mining — the peer-to-peer computer computations by which transactions are validated and verified. This requires a large amount of energy. In June 2018, the Bank for International Settlements criticized the use of public proof-of-work blockchains for their high energy consumption.[156][157][158]
Early concern over the high energy consumption was a factor in later blockchains such as Cardano (2017), Solana (2020) and Polkadot (2020) adopting the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake model. Researchers have estimated that bitcoin consumes 100,000 times as much energy as proof-of-stake networks.[159][160]
In 2021, a study by Cambridge University determined that bitcoin (at 121 terawatt-hours per year) used more electricity than Argentina (at 121TWh) and the Netherlands (109TWh).[161] According to Digiconomist, one bitcoin transaction required 708 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy, the amount an average U.S. household consumed in 24 days.[162]
In February 2021, U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen called bitcoin "an extremely inefficient way to conduct transactions", saying "the amount of energy consumed in processing those transactions is staggering".[163] In March 2021, Bill Gates stated that "Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind", adding "It's not a great climate thing."[164]
Nicholas Weaver, of the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, examined blockchain's online security, and the energy efficiency of proof-of-work public blockchains, and in both cases found it grossly inadequate.[165][166] The 31TWh-45TWh of electricity used for bitcoin in 2018 produced 17–23 million tonnes of CO2.[167][168] By 2022, the University of Cambridge and Digiconomist estimated that the two largest proof-of-work blockchains, bitcoin and Ethereum, together used twice as much electricity in one year as the whole of Sweden, leading to the release of up to 120 million tonnes of CO2 each year.[169]
Some cryptocurrency developers are considering moving from the proof-of-work model to the proof-of-stake model.[170] In Sept, 2022, Ethereum converted from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.[171]
In October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology access to $100 of bitcoin. The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology.[172] Many universities have founded departments focusing on crypto and blockchain, including MIT, in 2017. In the same year, Edinburgh became "one of the first big European universities to launch a blockchain course", according to the Financial Times.[173]
Motivations for adopting blockchain technology (an aspect of innovation adoption) have been investigated by researchers. For example, Janssen, et al. provided a framework for analysis,[174] and Koens & Poll pointed out that adoption could be heavily driven by non-technical factors.[175] Based on behavioral models, Li[176] has discussed the differences between adoption at the individual level and organizational levels.
Scholars in business and management have started studying the role of blockchains to support collaboration.[177][178] It has been argued that blockchains can foster both cooperation (i.e., prevention of opportunistic behavior) and coordination (i.e., communication and information sharing). Thanks to reliability, transparency, traceability of records, and information immutability, blockchains facilitate collaboration in a way that differs both from the traditional use of contracts and from relational norms. Contrary to contracts, blockchains do not directly rely on the legal system to enforce agreements.[179] In addition, contrary to the use of relational norms, blockchains do not require a trust or direct connections between collaborators.
Blockchain and internal audit
The need for internal audits to provide effective oversight of organizational efficiency will require a change in the way that information is accessed in new formats.[181] Blockchain adoption requires a framework to identify the risk of exposure associated with transactions using blockchain. The Institute of Internal Auditors has identified the need for internal auditors to address this transformational technology. New methods are required to develop audit plans that identify threats and risks. The Internal Audit Foundation study, Blockchain and Internal Audit, assesses these factors.[182] The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has outlined new roles for auditors as a result of blockchain.[183]
In blockchain technology, a testnet is an instance of a blockchain powered by the same or a newer version of the underlying software, to be used for testing and experimentation without risk to real funds or the main chain.[184] Testnet coins are separate and distinct from the official mainnet coins, don't have value, and can be obtained freely from faucets.[185]
Testnets allow for the development of blockchain applications without the risk of losing funds.[186]
Using testnets, a bug was discovered in the Bitcoin Core software that gave miners the ability to take down essential parts of the Bitcoin infrastructure (nodes) by sending a 'bad' block to the blockchain.[187]
A mainnet (short for main network) is the fully operational version of a blockchain where real transactions occur, as opposed to a testnet. It is secured through consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake and supports smart contracts, token transfers, and decentralized applications.[188]
A mainnet launch marks the transition from a testnet to a live blockchain, involving security audits, network deployment, and token migration.[189]
In September 2015, the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology research, Ledger, was announced. The inaugural issue was published in December 2016.[190] The journal covers aspects of mathematics, computer science, engineering, law, economics and philosophy that relate to cryptocurrencies.[191][192] The journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers, which are then timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address on the first page of their papers for non-repudiation purposes.[193]

- Precious commodities mining — Blockchain technology has been used for tracking the origins of gemstones and other precious commodities. In 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that the blockchain technology company Everledger was partnering with IBM's blockchain-based tracking service to trace the origin of diamonds to ensure that they were ethically mined.[114] As of 2019, the Diamond Trading Company (DTC) has been involved in building a diamond trading supply chain product called Tracer.[115]
- Food supply — As of 2018, Walmart and IBM were running a trial to use a blockchain-backed system for supply chain monitoring for lettuce and spinach – all nodes of the blockchain were administered by Walmart and located on the IBM cloud.[116]
- Fashion industry — There is an opaque relationship between brands, distributors, and customers in the fashion industry, which prevents the sustainable and stable development of the fashion industry. Blockchain could make this information transparent, assisting sustainable development of the industry.[117]
- Motor vehicles — Mercedes-Benz and partner Icertis developed a blockchain prototype used to facilitate consistent documentation of contracts along the supply chain so that the ethical standards and contractual obligations required of its direct suppliers can be passed on to second tier suppliers and beyond.[118][119] In another project, the company uses blockchain technology to track the emissions of climate-relevant gases and the amount of secondary material along the supply chain for its battery cell manufacturers.[120]

==================================================
Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that securely stores records across a network of computers in a way that is transparent, immutable, and resistant to tampering. Each "block" contains data, and blocks are linked in a chronological "chain."
What Is a Blockchain?
A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared across a computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable—meaning it cannot  be altered.
Since a block can’t be changed, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This reduces the need for trusted third parties, such as auditors or other humans, who add costs and can make mistakes.
Since Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.

How Does a Blockchain Work?
You might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. The key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.
A blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: entering and accessing information, and saving and storing it somewhere. A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.
The Bitcoin blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a 4MB file called a block (different blockchains have different size blocks). Once the block is full, the block data is run through a cryptographic hash function, which creates a hexadecimal number called the block header hash.
The hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in that block's header, creating a chain of blocks, hence the name “blockchain.”
Transactions follow a specific process, depending on the blockchain. For example, on Bitcoin's blockchain, if you initiate a transaction using your cryptocurrency wallet—the application that provides an interface for the blockchain—it starts a sequence of events.
In Bitcoin, your transaction is sent to a memory pool, where it is stored and queued until a miner picks it up. Once it is entered into a block and the block fills up with transactions, it is closed, and the mining begins.
Every node in the network proposes its own blocks in this way because they all choose different transactions. Each works on their own blocks, trying to find a solution to the difficulty target, using the "nonce," short for number used once.
The nonce value is a field in the block header that is changeable, and its value incrementally increases with every mining attempt. If the resulting hash isn't equal to or less than the target hash, a value of one is added to the nonce, a new hash is generated, and so on. The nonce rolls over about every 4.5 billion attempts (which takes less than one second) and uses another value called the extra nonce as an additional counter. This continues until a miner generates a valid hash, winning the race and receiving the reward.
Generating these hashes until a specific value is found is the "proof-of-work" you hear so much about—it "proves" the miner did the work. The sheer amount of work it takes to validate the hash is why the Bitcoin network consumes so much computational power and energy.
Once a block is closed, a transaction is complete. However, the block is not considered confirmed until five other blocks have been validated. Confirmation takes the network about one hour to complete because it averages just under 10 minutes per block (the first block with your transaction and five following blocks multiplied by 10 equals 60 minutes).
Not all blockchains follow this process. For instance, the Ethereum network randomly chooses one validator from all users with ether staked to validate blocks, which are then confirmed by the network. This is much faster and less energy intensive than Bitcoin's process.
Blockchain Decentralization
A blockchain allows the data in a database to be spread out among several network nodes—computers or devices running software for the blockchain—at various locations. This creates redundancy and maintains the fidelity of the data. For example, if someone tries to alter a record on one node, the other nodes would prevent it from happening by comparing block hashes. This way, no single node can alter information within the chain.
Because of this distribution—and the encrypted proof that work was done—the blockchain data, such as transaction history, becomes irreversible. Such a record could be a list of transactions, but private blockchains can also hold a variety of other information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's inventory. Most blockchains wouldn't "store" these items directly; they would likely be sent through a hashing algorithm and represented on the blockchain by a token.
Blockchain Transparency
Because of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by downloading and inspecting them or by using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track a bitcoin wherever it goes.
For example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, resulting in the loss of large amounts of cryptocurrency. While the hackers may have been anonymous—except for their wallet address—the crypto they extracted is easily traceable because the wallet addresses are stored on the blockchain.
Of course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the person assigned an address can reveal their identity. As a result, blockchain users can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.
Is Blockchain Secure?
Blockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the "end" of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, previous blocks cannot be altered.
A change in any data changes the hash of the block it was in. Because each block contains the previous block's hash, a change in one would change the following blocks. The network would generally reject an altered block because the hashes would not match. However, a change can be accomplished on smaller blockchain networks.
Not all blockchains are 100% impenetrable. They are distributed ledgers that use code to create the security level they have become known for. If there are vulnerabilities in the coding, they can be exploited.
A new and smaller chain might be susceptible to this kind of attack, but the attacker would need at least half of the computational power of the network (a 51% attack). On the Bitcoin and other larger blockchains, this is nearly impossible. By the time the hacker takes any action, the network is likely to have moved past the blocks they were trying to alter. This is because the rate at which these networks hash is exceptionally rapid—the Bitcoin network hashed at a rate of around 640 exahashes per second (18 zeros) as of September 2024.1
The Ethereum blockchain is not likely to be hacked either—again, the attackers would need to control more than half of the blockchain's staked ether. As of September 2024, over 33.8 million ETH  has been staked by more than one million validators.2 An attacker or a group would need to own over 17 million ETH, and be randomly selected to validate blocks enough times to get their blocks implemented.3
Bitcoin vs. Blockchain
Blockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with.4 But it wasn’t until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009, that blockchain had its first real-world application.
The Bitcoin protocol is built on a blockchain. In a research paper introducing the digital currency, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, referred to it as “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”5
The key thing to understand is that Bitcoin uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a ledger of payments or other transactions between parties.
Blockchain can be used to immutably record any number of data points. The data can be transactions, votes in an election, product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, and much more.
Currently, tens of thousands of projects are looking to implement blockchains in various ways to help society other than just recording transactions—for example, as a way to vote securely in democratic elections.
The nature of blockchain's immutability means that fraudulent voting would become far more difficult. For example, a voting system could work such that each country's citizens would be issued a single cryptocurrency or token.
Each candidate could then be given a specific wallet address, and the voters would send their token or crypto to the address of whichever candidate they wish to vote for. The transparent and traceable nature of blockchain would eliminate the need for human vote counting and the ability of bad actors to tamper with physical ballots.
Blockchains have been heralded as a disruptive force in the finance sector, especially with the functions of payments and banking. However, banks and decentralized blockchains are vastly different.
To see how a bank differs from blockchain, let’s compare the banking system to Bitcoin’s blockchain implementation.
How Are Blockchains Used?
As we now know, blocks on Bitcoin’s blockchain store transactional data. Today, tens of thousands of other cryptocurrencies run on a blockchain. But it turns out that blockchain can be a reliable way to store other types of data as well.
Some companies experimenting with blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, and Unilever, among others. For example, IBM has created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food products take to get to their locations.6
Why do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and listeria; in some cases, hazardous materials were accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating.
Using blockchain allows brands to track a food product’s route from its origin, through each stop it makes, to delivery. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come in contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner—potentially saving lives. This is one example of blockchain in practice, but many other forms of blockchain implementation exist or are being experimented with.
Perhaps no industry stands to benefit from integrating blockchain into its business operations more than personal banking. Financial institutions only operate during business hours, usually five days a week. That means if you try to deposit a check on Friday at 6 p.m., you will likely have to wait until Monday morning to see the money in your account.
Even if you make your deposit during business hours, the transaction can still take one to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks need to settle. Blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps.
By integrating blockchain into banks, consumers might see their transactions processed in minutes or seconds—the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays or the time of day or week. With blockchain, banks also have the opportunity to exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. Given the sums involved, even the few days the money is in transit can carry significant costs and risks for banks.
The settlement and clearing process for stock traders can take up to three days (or longer if trading internationally), meaning that the money and shares are frozen for that period. Blockchain can, in theory, drastically reduce that time.
Blockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This design also allows for easier cross-border transactions because it bypasses currency restrictions, instabilities, or lack of infrastructure by using a distributed network that can reach anyone with an internet connection.
Healthcare providers can leverage blockchain to store their patients’ medical records securely. When a medical record is generated and signed, it can be written into the blockchain, which provides patients with proof and confidence that the record cannot be changed. These personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key so that they are only accessible to specific individuals, thereby ensuring privacy.
If you have ever spent time in your local Recorder’s Office, you will know that recording property rights is both burdensome and inefficient. Today, a physical deed must be delivered to a government employee at the local recording office, where it is manually entered into the county’s central database and public index. In the case of a property dispute, claims to the property must be reconciled with the public index.
This process is not just costly and time-consuming, it is also prone to human error, where each inaccuracy makes tracking property ownership less efficient. Blockchain has the potential to eliminate the need for scanning documents and tracking down physical files in a local recording office. If property ownership is stored and verified on the blockchain, owners can trust that their deed is accurate and permanently recorded.
Proving property ownership can be nearly impossible in war-torn countries or areas with little to no government or financial infrastructure and no Recorder’s Office. If a group of people living in such an area can leverage blockchain, then transparent and clear timelines of property ownership could be maintained.
A smart contract is computer code that can be built into the blockchain to facilitate transactions. It operates under a set of conditions to which users agree. When those conditions are met, the smart contract conducts the transaction for the users.
As in the IBM Food Trust example, suppliers can use blockchain to record the origins of materials that they have purchased. This would allow companies to verify the authenticity of not only their products but also common labels such as “Organic,” “Local,” and “Fair Trade.”
As reported by Forbes, the food industry is increasingly adopting the use of blockchain to track the path and safety of food throughout the farm-to-user journey.7
As mentioned above, blockchain could facilitate a modern voting system. Voting with blockchain carries the potential to eliminate election fraud and boost voter turnout, as was tested in the November 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia.8
Using blockchain in this way would make votes nearly impossible to tamper with. The blockchain protocol would also maintain transparency in the electoral process, reducing the personnel needed to conduct an election and providing officials with nearly instant results. This would eliminate the need for recounts or any real concern that fraud might threaten the election.
Pros and Cons of Blockchain
For all of its complexity, blockchain’s potential as a decentralized form of record-keeping is almost without limit. From greater user privacy and heightened security to lower processing fees and fewer errors, blockchain technology may very well see applications beyond those outlined above. But there are also some disadvantages.
Improved accuracy by removing human involvement in verification
Cost reductions by eliminating third-party verification
Decentralization makes it harder to tamper with
Transactions are secure, private, and efficient
Transparent technology
Provides a banking alternative and a way to secure personal information for citizens of countries with unstable or underdeveloped governments
Significant technology cost associated with some blockchains
Low number of transactions per second
History of use in illicit activities, such as on the dark web
Regulation varies by jurisdiction and remains uncertain
Data storage limitations
Benefits of Blockchains
Accuracy of the Chain
Transactions on the blockchain network are approved by thousands of computers and devices. This removes almost all people from the verification process, resulting in less human error and an accurate record of information. Even if a computer on the network were to make a computational mistake, the error would only be made to one copy of the blockchain and not be accepted by the rest of the network.
Typically, consumers pay a bank to verify a transaction or a notary to sign a document. Blockchain eliminates the need for third-party verification—and, with it, their associated costs. For example, business owners incur a small fee when they accept credit card payments because banks and payment-processing companies have to process those transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have a central authority and has limited transaction fees.
Blockchain does not store any of its information in a central location. Instead, the blockchain is copied and spread across a network of computers. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every computer on the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change.
By spreading that information across a network, rather than storing it in one central database, blockchain becomes significantly more difficult to tamper with.
Efficient Transactions
Transactions placed through a central authority can take up to a few days to settle. If you attempt to deposit a check on Friday evening, for example, you may not actually see funds in your account until Monday morning. Financial institutions operate during business hours, usually five days a week—but a blockchain runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year.
On some blockchains, transactions can be completed and considered secure in minutes. This is particularly useful for cross-border trades, which usually take much longer because of time zone issues and the fact that all parties must confirm payment processing.
Many blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning anyone with an internet connection can view a list of the network’s transaction history. Although users can access transaction details, they cannot access identifying information about the users making those transactions. It is a common misperception that blockchain networks like Bitcoin are fully anonymous; they are actually pseudonymous because there is a viewable address that can be associated with a user if the information gets out.
Once a transaction is recorded, its authenticity must be verified by the blockchain network. After the transaction is validated, it is added to the blockchain block. Each block on the blockchain contains its unique hash and the unique hash of the block before it. Therefore, the blocks cannot be altered once the network confirms them.
Many blockchains are entirely open source. This means that everyone can view its code. This gives auditors the ability to review cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for security. However, it also means there is no real authority on who controls Bitcoin’s code or how it is edited. Because of this, anyone can suggest changes or upgrades to the system. If a majority of the network users agree that the new version of the code with the upgrade is sound and worthwhile, then Bitcoin can be updated.
Private or permission blockchains may not allow for public transparency, depending on how they are designed or their purpose. These types of blockchains might be made only for an organization that wishes to track data accurately without allowing anyone outside of the permissioned users to see it.
Alternatively, there might come a point where publicly traded companies are required to provide investors with financial transparency through a regulator-approved blockchain reporting system. Using blockchains in business accounting and financial reporting would prevent companies from altering their financials to appear more profitable than they really are.
Perhaps the most profound facet of blockchain and cryptocurrency is the ability for anyone, regardless of ethnicity, gender, location, or cultural background, to use it. According to The World Bank, an estimated 1.4 billion adults do not have bank accounts or any means of storing their money or wealth.9 Moreover, nearly all of these individuals live in developing countries where the economy is in its infancy and entirely dependent on cash.
These people are often paid in physical cash. They then need to store this physical cash in hidden locations in their homes or other places, incentivizing robbers or violence. While not impossible to steal, crypto makes it more difficult for would-be thieves.
Drawbacks of Blockchains
Although blockchain can save users money on transaction fees, the technology is far from free. For example, the Bitcoin network's proof-of-work system to validate transactions consumes vast amounts of computational power. In the real world, the energy consumed by the millions of devices on the Bitcoin network is more than the country of Pakistan consumes annually.10
Some solutions to these issues are beginning to arise. For example, bitcoin-mining farms have been set up to use solar power, excess natural gas from fracking sites, or energy from wind farms.
Speed and Data Inefficiency
Bitcoin is a perfect case study of the inefficiencies of blockchain. Bitcoin's PoW system takes about 10 minutes to add a new block to the blockchain. At that rate, it's estimated that the blockchain network can only manage about seven transactions per second (TPS).11 Although other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, perform better than Bitcoin, the complex structure of blockchain still limits them. Legacy brand Visa, for context, can process 65,000 TPS.12
Solutions to this issue have been in development for years. There are currently blockchain projects that claim tens of thousands of TPS. Ethereum is rolling out a series of upgrades that include data sampling, binary large objects (BLOBs), and rollups. These improvements are expected to increase network participation, reduce congestion, decrease fees, and increase transaction speeds.13
The other issue with many blockchains is that each block can only hold so much data. The block size debate has been and continues to be one of the most pressing issues for the scalability of blockchains in the future.
While confidentiality on the blockchain network protects users from hacks and preserves privacy, it also allows for illegal trading and activity on the blockchain network. The most cited example of blockchain being used for illicit transactions is probably the Silk Road, an online dark web illegal-drug and money laundering marketplace operating from February 2011 until October 2013, when the FBI shut it down.14
The dark web allows users to buy and sell illegal goods without being tracked by using the Tor Browser and make illicit purchases in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. This is in stark contrast to U.S. regulations, which require financial service providers to obtain information about their customers when they open an account. They are supposed to verify the identity of each customer and confirm that they do not appear on any list of known or suspected terrorist organizations.15
Illicit activity accounted for only 0.34% of all cryptocurrency transactions in 2023.16
This system can be seen as both a pro and a con. It gives anyone access to financial accounts, but allows criminals to transact more easily. Many have argued that the good uses of crypto, like banking the unbanked, outweigh the bad uses of cryptocurrency, especially when most illegal activity is still accomplished through untraceable cash.
Public perception of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, in particular, remains uneasy. High-profile collapses of once-trusted cryptocurrency brokers, such as Mt. Gox back in 2014, or FTX in November 2022, persistence of various crypto scams, and general skepticism towards new technology and its bold promises, all contribute to ongoing public skepticism about a decentralized future. As of 2024, 44% of Americans still say they will never purchase a cryptocurrency.17
Many in the crypto space have expressed concerns about government regulation of cryptocurrencies. Several jurisdictions are tightening control over certain types of crypto and other virtual currencies. However, no regulations have yet been introduced that focus on restricting blockchain uses and development, only certain products created using it.
Another significant implication of blockchains is that they require storage. This may not appear to be substantial because we already store lots of information and data. However, as time passes, the growing blockchain use will require more storage, especially on blockchains where nodes store the entire chain.
Currently, data storage is centralized in large centers. But if the world transitions to blockchain for every industry and use, its exponentially growing size would require more advanced techniques to make storage more efficient, or force participants to continually upgrade their storage.
This could become significantly more expensive in terms of both money and physical space needed, as the Bitcoin blockchain itself was over 600 gigabytes as of September 15th, 2024—and this blockchain records only bitcoin transactions.18 This is small compared to the amount of data stored in large data centers, but a growing number of blockchains will only add to the amount of storage already required for the digital world.19
What Exactly Is a Blockchain?
Simply put, a blockchain is a shared database or ledger. Bits of data are stored in files known as blocks, and each network node has a replica of the entire database. Security is ensured since the majority of nodes will not accept a change if someone tries to edit or delete an entry in one copy of the ledger.
What Is a Blockchain in Easy Terms?
Imagine you typed some information into a document on your computer and sent it through a program that gave you a string of numbers and letters (called hashing, with the string called a hash). You add this hash to the beginning of another document and type information into it. Again, you use the program to create a hash, which you add to the following document. Each hash is a representation of the previous document, which creates a chain of encoded documents that cannot be altered without changing the hash. Each document is stored on computers in a network. This network of programs compares each document with the ones they have stored and accepts them as valid based on the hashes they generate. If a document doesn't generate a hash that is a match, that document is rejected by the network.
What Is a Blockchain for Beginners?
A blockchain is a distributed network of files chained together using programs that create hashes, or strings of numbers and letters that represent the information contained in the files. Every network participant is a computer or device that compares these hashes to the one they generate. If there is a match, the file is kept. If there isn't, the file is rejected.
With many practical applications for the technology already being implemented and explored, blockchain is finally making a name for itself in no small part because of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. As a buzzword on the tongue of every investor across the globe, blockchain stands to make business and government operations more accurate, efficient, secure, and cheap, with fewer intermediaries.
As we head into the third decade of blockchain, it’s no longer a question of if legacy companies will catch on to the technology—it’s a question of when. Today, we see a proliferation of NFTs and the tokenization of assets. Tomorrow, we may see a combination of blockchains, tokens, and artificial intelligence all incorporated into business and consumer solutions.

Senior Editorial Strategist
Blockchain is a shared, immutable digital ledger, enabling the recording of transactions and the tracking of assets within a business network and providing a single source of truth.
Blockchain operates as a decentralized distributed database, with data stored across multiple computers, making it resistant to tampering. Transactions are validated through a consensus mechanism, ensuring agreement across the network.
In blockchain technology, each transaction is grouped into blocks, which are then linked together, forming a secure and transparent chain. This structure guarantees data integrity and provides a tamper-proof record, making blockchain ideal for applications like cryptocurrencies and supply chain management.
The key benefit of blockchain lies in its ability to provide security, transparency and trust without relying on traditional intermediaries, such as banks or other third parties. Its design reduces the risk of fraud and errors, making it especially valuable in industries where secure transactions are critical, including finance and healthcare. In addition, blockchain helps businesses improve efficiency and reduce costs by streamlining processes and enhancing accountability.

The evolution of blockchain
Blockchain technology began with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, created by an anonymous figure or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin’s underlying technology was designed as a decentralized digital currency to enable peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a trusted intermediary like a bank. The blockchain served as a public ledger, securely recording all transactions and preventing double-spending, a key issue for digital currencies at the time.
With the development of platforms like Ethereum in 2015, blockchain began to support smart contracts—digital contracts stored on a blockchain that are automatically executed when predetermined terms and conditions are met.
This development broadened blockchain’s real-world applications, extending into areas such as real estate, finance, supply chain management, healthcare and even voting systems. Over time, blockchain has grown well beyond its cryptocurrency roots, becoming a key player in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
Today, blockchain continues to evolve, with ongoing advancements aimed at improving scalability, privacy and its integration with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT).
According to a report from Statista, blockchain technology is forecast to grow by nearly 1 trillion US dollars by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56.1% since 2021.1
Our clients have a vision for how blockchain will change their business, and we have an approach to make it happen. Let's co-create successful and growing business networks together.
Benefits of blockchain
Blockchain technology offers various benefits that transform businesses’ operations, enhancing trust, security, traceability and efficiency across multiple industries.
Here are some top benefits of blockchain:
Blockchain creates a secure, members-only network, ensuring accurate and timely data access. Confidential records are shared only with authorized network members, fostering trust and creating end-to-end visibility across the system.
Consensus among network members is required to validate data accuracy, and all validated transactions are immutable and permanently recorded. This capability guarantees that no transaction can be deleted, even by a system administrator.
Blockchain offers instant traceability with a transparent audit trail of an asset’s journey. In industries prioritizing sustainability, it enables direct sharing of provenance data, verifying ethical practices. It can also reveal supply chain inefficiencies, such as delays, driving greater accountability.
With a distributed ledger shared among network members, the need for time-consuming record reconciliations is eliminated. Smart contracts, which are stored on the blockchain, can automate processes and speed up transactions.
Smart contracts facilitate the seamless automation of transactions, enhancing efficiency and accelerating real-time processes. When predefined conditions are met, they automatically trigger the next step, reducing the need for manual intervention.
Key features of blockchain technology
Blockchain technology contains several key features that enhance security, transparency and efficiency in transactions and data management:
Distributed ledger technology
All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions. This shared ledger records transactions only once, eliminating the duplication of effort typical of traditional business networks.
No participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it’s been recorded in the shared ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions are then visible.
Smart contracts are self-executing agreements stored on the blockchain, where the terms are written in code and automatically executed when predefined conditions are met. They can be used for various purposes, such as transferring corporate bonds or triggering travel insurance payouts. By automating these processes, smart contracts speed up transactions, reduce the need for intermediaries and ensure transparency and security.
Public key cryptography
Public key cryptography is a method used to secure transactions and data on the blockchain by leveraging two cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key serves as an address for receiving cryptocurrency or data, while the private key is a confidential key that grants control over the associated digital assets. The private key holder can authorize transactions, providing security and verifying ownership, while the public key allows others to send funds or data to the correct address.
Blockchain technology records transactions securely by linking data blocks together. Each block contains important details about asset movements and ensures the integrity of the entire process. Here’s how it works.
Records transactions as blocks
Each transaction is recorded as a “block” of data on the blockchain. These blocks capture key details about the movement of assets, whether tangible (such as a product) or intangible (such as intellectual property). The data within each block includes critical information, such as who, what, when, where, the transaction amount, and specific conditions like the temperature of a food shipment.
In addition, each block contains a timestamp, which records the exact moment the transaction is added to the blockchain. This timestamp ensures the chronological order of transactions and adds an additional layer of verifiability to the data, preventing any retrospective alterations to the recorded information.
Connects blocks together
Each block is linked to the previous block and the one after it, creating a secure chain of data. This chain is done through cryptographic hashes, unique identifiers for each block. The hash of a block includes data from the previous block, ensuring the exact sequence and timing of each transaction. The cryptographic hash makes it nearly impossible to alter any block without changing all subsequent blocks, ensuring the integrity of the entire process.
Builds an irreversible blockchain
The blocks are grouped in an irreversible chain known as a blockchain. Each new block reinforces the security and validation of the previous one, strengthening the entire chain. This Bitcoin-based architecture is what makes decentralized systems so secure and reliable.
Nodes in the blockchain network validate and maintain the blockchain by confirming each transaction’s validity through consensus algorithms, ensuring the system remains secure and immutable. Proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS) are some of the most commonly used consensus algorithms in blockchain networks, each helping to secure the system while validating transactions.
Ensures trust and immutability
With each new block, the blockchain becomes more secure, making it nearly impossible to change past transactions. This immutability provides a trusted, transparent ledger that all network members can rely on, preventing fraud and ensuring that all transaction records are accurate and unchangeable.
Types of blockchain networks
There are several ways to build a blockchain network. They can be public, private, permissioned or consortium-built:
Blockchain protocols and platforms
Blockchain protocols are the set of rules that govern how data is recorded, shared and secured within a blockchain network. These protocols establish the foundation for the network’s operation. However, to fully take advantage of these protocols, developers need a platform that provides the environment and tools to build, deploy and interact with decentralized applications (dApps).
Therefore, blockchain platforms, build on top of these protocols, offering the necessary infrastructure and services to create and run apps within the blockchain ecosystem. While protocols define the core functionality, platforms extend this functionality by enabling the development of practical solutions.
Blockchain protocols and platforms often overlap, as platforms usually rely on specific protocols to operate.
Here’s a rundown of common blockchain protocols and platforms:
Hyperledger Fabric, an open source project from the Linux® Foundation, is the modular blockchain framework and has become the unofficial standard for enterprise blockchain platforms like the IBM Blockchain® Platform. Intended as a foundation for developing enterprise-grade applications and industry strategies, the open, modular architecture of Hyperledger Fabric uses plug-and-play components to accommodate a wide range of business use cases.
Ethereum is a decentralized, open source blockchain platform that allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications. Ethereum Enterprise is designed specifically for business blockchain applications.
Corda is a distributed ledger platform designed for businesses, enabling secure and private transactions on permissioned networks. It allows organizations to share data and execute agreements with only the relevant parties, making it ideal for industries like finance, healthcare and supply chain management. Corda prioritizes privacy, scalability and regulatory compliance.
Quorum is an open source, permissioned blockchain platform based on Ethereum, designed for enterprise use. It provides high privacy and scalability, allowing businesses to run smart contracts and conduct transactions securely within a private network. Quorum supports features like transaction privacy and faster consensus mechanisms, making it ideal for financial institutions where confidentiality and regulatory compliance are crucial.
Blockchain and security
When building an enterprise blockchain application, it’s essential to have a comprehensive blockchain security strategy that uses cybersecurity frameworks, assurance services and best practices to reduce risks against attacks and fraud. This strategy should encompass key areas like identity and access management (IAM), ensuring only authorized users can access critical components, and employ strong encryption techniques for data protection. In addition, adopting effective consensus mechanisms that are resistant to attacks is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the network.
Other important security imperatives include the following:
The difference between blockchain and Bitcoin
Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency to enable peer-to-peer transactions without a central authority. It uses blockchain technology as its underlying infrastructure, acting as a distributed ledger that records and verifies all Bitcoin transactions.
As the most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin plays a central role in the blockchain ecosystem, but it’s also part of a broader and evolving market. The pricing in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space is highly volatile, with factors such as technological advancements, market sentiment, investor demand and regulatory changes playing a significant role.
Combining blockchain and AI creates new opportunities for businesses across various industries. Using blockchain’s immutable ledger and decentralization, AI can improve data transparency and security, addressing challenges like explainable AI.
For example, in supply chain management, blockchain ensures the traceability and authenticity of products, while AI analyzes data to predict demand and optimize logistics. AI helps automate risk assessments in financial services, while blockchain secures transactions and ensures compliance.
Beyond these applications, the integration of blockchain and AI is also making significant strides in industries like healthcare. Healthcare providers are using AI to analyze patient data for personalized treatments and blockchain solutions to ensure the privacy and security of medical records. This convergence enhances trust, boosts efficiency and supports process automation, leading to faster, more reliable business operations across industries.

- Public blockchain networks: A public blockchain is open for anyone to join and participate in, such as the Bitcoin blockchain. While it offers decentralization, it also comes with drawbacks, including high computational power requirements, lack of transaction privacy and potentially weaker security. These considerations are crucial, especially for enterprise blockchain use cases.
- Private blockchain networks: A private blockchain network, similar to a public blockchain network, is a decentralized peer-to-peer network. However, one organization governs the network, controlling who is allowed to participate, run a consensus protocol and maintain the shared ledger. Depending on the use case, this infrastructure can significantly boost trust and confidence between participants. A private blockchain can be run behind a corporate firewall and even be hosted on premises.
- Permissioned blockchain networks: Businesses that set up a private blockchain set up a permissioned blockchain network. It is important to mention that public blockchain networks can also be permissioned. This places restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network and in what record transactions. Participants need to obtain an invitation or permission to join.
- Consortium blockchain networks: A group of preselected organizations actively manages a consortium blockchain network and shares the responsibility of maintaining the blockchain. These organizations determine who can submit transactions and access data. This type of network is ideal when multiple parties must collaborate with shared responsibilities. In the energy sector, energy producers and consumers might share data about power usage and distribution.
- Hyperledger Fabric
- Regularly audit and test smart contracts for vulnerabilities, as flaws in their code can lead to serious security breaches.
- Comply with industry regulations, such as GDPR or financial standards through the implementation of privacy-enhancing technologies like zero-knowledge proofs.
- Integrate secure messaging protocols to facilitate confidential communication within the blockchain-based network, ensuring that messages and transactions remain private and tamper-proof.
- Employ continuous monitoring and a well-defined incident response plan to ensure that any security issues are detected and addressed promptly, minimizing the impact of potential threats.

==================================================
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that's shared across a network of computers to keep a digital record of transactions. Blockchain is known for its role in cryptocurrency systems where it maintains a secure and decentralized record of transactions. However, its applications extend beyond cryptocurrencies to various fields, including supply chain management, healthcare and finance.
Each computer in a blockchain network maintains a copy of the ledger where transactions are recorded to prevent a single point of failure. All copies of the blockchain are updated and validated simultaneously.
Blockchain is also considered a type of database, but it differs from conventional databases in how it stores and manages information. Instead of storing data in rows, columns, tables and files as traditional databases do, a blockchain stores data in blocks that are digitally chained together. It's a decentralized database managed by computers belonging to a peer-to-peer network instead of a central computer such as in traditional databases.
Blockchains offer a secure, transparent and efficient way to manage and verify data across diverse industries. Bitcoin, launched in 2009 on the bitcoin blockchain, was the first cryptocurrency and popular application to successfully use blockchain. As a result, blockchain has been most often associated with bitcoin and alternatives such as dogecoin and bitcoin cash, both of which use their own public ledgers.

There are four main types of blockchain:
How blockchain and distributed ledger technology work
Blockchain uses a multistep process that includes the following five steps:
These steps take place in near real time and involve a range of elements. Nodes in public blockchain networks are referred to as miners; they're typically paid for this task -- often in processes called proof of work (PoW) or proof of stake (PoS) -- usually in the form of cryptocurrency.
A blockchain ledger consists of two types of records: individual transactions and blocks. The first block has a header and data that pertain to transactions taking place within a set time period. The block's timestamp is used to help create an alphanumeric string called a hash. After the first block has been created, each subsequent block in the ledger uses the previous block's hash to calculate its own hash.
Before a new block can be added to the chain, its authenticity must be verified by a computational process called validation or consensus. At this point in the blockchain process, a majority of nodes in the network must agree the new block's hash has been calculated correctly. Consensus ensures that all copies of the blockchain distributed ledger share the same state.
Once a block has been added, it can be referenced in subsequent blocks, but it can't be changed. If someone attempts to swap out a block, the hashes for previous and subsequent blocks will also change and disrupt the ledger's shared state.
When consensus is no longer possible, other computers in the network are aware that a problem has occurred, and no new blocks are added to the chain until the problem is solved. Typically, the block causing the error will be discarded and the consensus process will be repeated. This eliminates a single point of failure.
Key features of blockchain technology
Blockchain technology is built on a foundation of unique characteristics that differentiate it from traditional databases. The following are its most important and defining characteristics:
Blockchain, digital currency, cryptocurrency and Bitcoin explained
The terms blockchain, cryptocurrency and bitcoin are frequently lumped together, along with digital currency, and sometimes they're erroneously used interchangeably. Although they all fall under the umbrella of DLT, each is a distinct entity.
Blockchain and smart contracts
Smart contracts are one of the most important features of blockchain technology. They are self-executing digital contracts written in code that operate automatically according to predefined rules and conditions. Smart contracts are designed to facilitate, verify and enforce the negotiation or performance of an agreement without the need for intermediaries, such as lawyers, banks or other third parties.
Once the smart contract's conditions are met, it automatically executes the agreed-upon actions or transactions in the contract. After the transaction is complete, the smart contract is permanently recorded on the blockchain, confirming its immutability so it can't be altered or deleted. Access to transaction details can be restricted so only authorized parties can view the results.
Smart contracts are typically deployed on blockchain platforms that provide the necessary security and transparency for their execution. Ethereum is a popular blockchain platform for smart contracts. It's used for a range of applications such as financial transactions, supply chain management, real estate deals and digital identity verification.
Smart contracts have several benefits. By eliminating intermediaries, smart contract technology reduces costs. It also cuts out complications and interference intermediaries can cause, speeding processes and enhancing security.
Additional blockchain examples and use cases
Blockchain continues to mature and gain acceptance as more companies across various industries learn to use it. Blockchain's use cases and industry applications have grown far outside its original cryptocurrency application to include smart contracts, cybersecurity, internet of things (IoT) and non-fungible tokens. NFTs are digital assets representing all or portions of real-world objects such as art or music. They're bought, sold and traded online, and they're a popular way to buy and sell digital artwork.
Some of blockchain technology's real-world applications include the following:
Organizations across various industries use blockchain-based applications as a secure and cost-effective way to create and manage a distributed database and to maintain records for all types of digital transactions. As a result, blockchain is increasingly viewed as a way of securely tracking and sharing data among multiple business entities.
Advantages of blockchain
Experts cite several key benefits to using blockchain, including the following:
Disadvantages of blockchain
According to experts, blockchain also has the following potential drawbacks, risks and challenges:
Leading blockchain platforms
According to Gartner reviews, examples of blockchain platforms include the following:
Blockchain adoption considerations
Any enterprise considering whether to implement a blockchain application should first consider whether it needs blockchain to achieve its objectives. Blockchain has several significant benefits, particularly in security, but it doesn't cater to all database needs and there are other alternatives for businesses to consider.
Conventional, centralized databases are often the better option in many circumstances, especially when speed and performance are critical factors. They're also better when transactions only happen inside the enterprise or between a limited number of entities where trust has been fully established.
In choosing a blockchain platform, an organization should keep in mind which consensus algorithm to use. The consensus algorithm is a core piece of a blockchain network and one that can have a big effect on speed. It's the procedure through which the peers in a blockchain network reach agreement about the present state of the distributed ledger. This helps to establish trust among users of the blockchain.
There are a few standard methods that blockchain and other distributed database platforms use to arrive at a consensus. Common consensus algorithms include the following:
When adopting blockchain technology, organizations should consider regulatory compliance requirements to ensure adherence to relevant laws and guidelines. Additionally, evaluating the costs of blockchain execution and maintenance, along with the user experience, is essential for encouraging adoption and maximizing its benefits.
Blockchain privacy and security
Privacy and security are major advantages of blockchain. Private data is stored in blocks. Blocks are always stored chronologically, and it's extremely difficult to change a block once it has been added to the end of the blockchain.
Each block has its own hash code that contains the hash code of the block that comes before it. If a hacker tries to edit a block or access its information, the block's hash will change, meaning the hacker would have to change every other block that comes after it, which would take a massive amount of computing power.
Blockchain technology is still susceptible to 51% attacks that can circumvent a consensus algorithm. With these attacks, an attacker has more than 50% control over all the computing power on a blockchain, giving them the ability to overwhelm the other participants on the network. This type of attack is unlikely, because it would take a large amount of effort and a lot of computing power to execute.
When adopting blockchain, organizations must weigh the pros and cons of choosing between public and private blockchains. Public blockchains such as bitcoin and ethereum offer transparency, but transactions are visible to anyone. Private blockchains provide more privacy, but the lack of transparency can raise trust issues among participants.
Protecting the data shared across the blockchain is also important because it involves distributing data across a decentralized network. Techniques including encryption and privacy-enhancing protocols help mitigate risks while ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
Blockchain vs. centralized ledgers
Blockchain technology and centralized ledgers have several key differences, including the following:
History of blockchain
The original idea for blockchain technology was considered decades ago. A protocol similar to blockchain was first proposed in a 1982 dissertation by David Chaum, an American computer scientist and cryptographer. In 1991, Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta expanded on the original description of a chain of blocks secured through cryptography. From this point on, various individuals began working on developing digital currencies.
In 2008, a developer or group of developers working under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto developed a white paper that established the model for blockchain, including the hash method used to timestamp blocks. In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto implemented a blockchain using the bitcoin currency. To this day, no one knows for sure who Satoshi Nakamoto is.
Interest in enterprise applications of blockchain has grown as the technology evolved and blockchain-based software and peer-to-peer networks designed for the enterprise came to market. Around 2014, blockchain technology applications -- distinct from their use in cryptocurrencies -- began to emerge as experts identified potential uses of the technology for other types of financial and organizational transactions.
Some specific early examples of enterprise applications include the following:
In recent years, several blockchain technology trends have arisen, including decentralized finance (DeFi), a type of financial framework based on the ethereum blockchain network. DeFi is different from centralized finance models within cryptocurrency markets in that there's no centralized authority that controls or intercedes in transactions.
The future of blockchain
Technologies such as AI, IoT, NFTs and the metaverse are expected to be greatly influenced by blockchain. Blockchain is also driving advancements in virtual reality by facilitating seamless interoperability between metaverse platforms and games, enabling users to easily transfer assets and characters across different virtual worlds.
Sharding, a technique to improve blockchain scalability by dividing it into smaller chunks for parallel transaction processing, is also gaining wider adoption. Initially discussed in the ethereum community in 2013, blockchain platform Zilliqa first adopted the technique. While sharding addresses scalability issues, full-scale sharding is still being developed for major platforms, including ethereum, with plans for future upgrades like ethereum 2.0.
However, blockchain is also facing legal and regulatory challenges, as well as controversies surrounding fraudulent activities, such as the high-profile collapse of exchange service FTX. Despite this, enterprises continue to invest in blockchain and its applications, most notably through the rise of NFTs and the NFT marketplace.

- Top 10 benefits of blockchain for business
- What are the 4 different types of blockchain technology?
- 7 must-have blockchain developer skills
- Private blockchain. Private, or permissioned, blockchains restrict access to a select group of participants and require approval to access. These blockchains offer enhanced privacy and control over data, making them suitable for applications that require strict access controls and compliance with regulations. In a private, permissioned blockchain, such as multichain, every node might be able to perform transactions, but participation in the consensus process is restricted to a limited number of approved nodes.
- Public blockchain. Public, or permissionless, blockchains don't require permission to enter the blockchain network. In a public, permissionless blockchain like bitcoin, anyone can view the transactions and actively participate in the network. These blockchains are highly decentralized, with no single entity controlling the network. Every node in a public blockchain network conducts transactions and participates in the consensus process.
- Hybrid blockchain. A hybrid blockchain combines the characteristics of permissioned and permissionless blockchains. A hybrid blockchain is set up by a single organization and consists of one public system on top of a private system, giving the organization access control over sensitive data.
- Consortium blockchain. Consortium, or federated, blockchain is a type of hybrid blockchain in which a group of organizations governs the blockchain. Consortium blockchains combine the benefits of decentralization and privacy, making them suitable for industries that require collaboration and trust among a select group of participants. However, the breach of just one member node can compromise its security.
- An authorized participant inputs a transaction, which must be authenticated by the technology.
- That action creates a block that represents the specific transaction or data.
- The block is sent to every computer node in the network.
- Authorized nodes validate transactions and add the block to the existing blockchain.
- The update is distributed across the network, which finalizes the transaction.
- Decentralization. Blockchain decentralization is one of the fundamental aspects of the technology. Unlike centralized databases where a central authority, such as a bank, controls and verifies transactions, blockchain operates on a distributed ledger. This means multiple transparent participants, known as nodes, maintain, verify and update the ledger. Each node is spread across a network and contains a copy of the whole blockchain.
- Immutability and security. Cryptographic algorithms are used in blockchain to provide strong security; they record transactions and make tampering nearly impossible. Information is stored in blocks that are linked together using cryptographic hashes. If someone tries to tamper or modify a block, they will have to change every subsequent block, making tampering computationally infeasible. This inherent blockchain security feature guarantees immutability of information and makes blockchain an ideal platform to store sensitive data and conduct secure transactions.
- Transparency and traceability. The inherent transparency of blockchain technology ensures every network participant has access to identical information. For instance, every transaction becomes part of a public ledger, visible to all participants. This transparency confirms trust and network accountability, because any inconsistency can be promptly recognized and resolved. Additionally, the blockchain's capacity to track the origin and trajectory of assets makes audits easier and decreases the likelihood of fraudulent activities.
- Smart contracts. These contracts are automated agreements that are encoded in software to automatically execute the stipulations of a contract. Smart contract codes are stored on the blockchain and carry out their functions once predetermined conditions are met. These contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, streamline transactions, save money and speed up closing times. They're used in a range of diverse sectors, including supply chain management, insurance and finance.
- Consensus mechanisms. Blockchain networks employ consensus algorithms, including PoW and PoS, to verify transactions. These algorithms ensure all network nodes agree on the ledger's state, fostering trust and security among participants.
- Blockchain is the technology that digital currency, cryptocurrency and bitcoin are built on. More specifically, it's the underlying technology that constructs a decentralized digital ledger that enables exchanges among multiple parties in a secure, immutable manner.
- Digital currency refers to any form of currency available in digital or electronic form and shared without an intermediary. This includes digital money issued by governments and central banks, as well as cryptocurrency. Digital currency is sometimes called digital money, electronic money, electronic currency or cybercash.
- Cryptocurrency is a digital asset that can be exchanged on a blockchain network. It's a subset of digital currency that isn't issued by government entities. Think of cryptocurrency as tokens private entities or groups issue that can also pay for items sold by those who also operate in the blockchain network.
- Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency. It was introduced by an anonymous person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network known as the bitcoin blockchain, which lets participants send and receive it without the need for intermediaries. New bitcoin is introduced to the supply through bitcoin mining, a process that requires significant computational power. Miners solve complex mathematical problems and the miner who solves the puzzle and validates the transaction is rewarded with new bitcoin.
- Supply chain management. The end-to-end visibility, traceability and accountability of blockchain is useful in managing supply chains. Stakeholders can record, track and authenticate products, prevent counterfeit goods from getting into the supply chain and streamline logistics processes.
- Healthcare. Along with artificial intelligence (AI) and IoT, blockchain has emerged as an innovative healthcare technology. In healthcare, blockchain technology is used to securely store and share patient data. It lets patients control their medical records, granting access to healthcare providers only when necessary. This allows seamless and secure sharing of medical information, improving treatment outcomes and reducing administrative burdens.
- Identity management. Blockchain-based identity management systems enhance security, privacy and control over personal data. By storing identity information on the blockchain, users can have a portable and verifiable digital identity. This eliminates the need for multiple identity documents, reduces identity theft and simplifies identity verification processes.
- Voting systems. Blockchain technology can address the challenges of traditional voting systems by providing secure and transparent voting platforms. Voting systems based on the technology eliminate voter fraud, ensure the integrity of the electoral process and enable remote voting while maintaining anonymity and privacy.
- Finance and banking. Financial services use blockchain to accelerate transactions and speed up close times. Some banks also use blockchain for contract management and traceability purposes. For example, PayPal, the online payment platform, launched a blockchain-based service in 2020 that lets users buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency. R3, a global consortium of financial institutions, developed its Corda platform to record, manage and synchronize financial information using blockchain application programming interfaces for specific platforms.
- Media and entertainment. Blockchain technology expands royalty opportunities for companies and individuals. For instance, organizations can use blockchain to create digital tickets that allow them to collect royalties if the ticket is resold. In April 2021, Live Nation SAS, the France-based arm of the global entertainment company of the same name, launched TixTo.Me, powered in part by blockchain company Aventus Network.
- Property records. In property record management, blockchain provides a secure, transparent and immutable system for recording ownership and transactions. Property ownership data is stored on a blockchain, so that all transactions such as sales, transfers and liens are permanently recorded and accessible to authorized parties. This eliminates the need for physical documentation and guarantees records can't be altered without network consensus, reducing fraud. Blockchain also enables faster, more efficient transactions through smart contracts, automating processes such as title transfers and escrow.
- Logistics. Logistics companies use blockchain to track and trace goods as they move through the supply chain.
- Government central banks and global finance. Government central banks and the global finance community have transitioned to blockchain with the introduction of central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a foundation for currency exchange.
- Uncorruptible. It's almost impossible to corrupt a blockchain because millions of computers share and continually reconcile the information. Blockchain also has no single point of failure.
- Efficient. Transactions are often more efficient than in non-DLT-based transactional systems, though public blockchains can sometimes suffer from slow speed and inefficiency.
- Resilient. Blockchain is resilient; if one node goes down, all the other nodes have a copy of the ledger.
- Trustworthy. It provides trust among participants on a network. Confirmed blocks are difficult to reverse, which means data is difficult to remove or change.
- Cost-effective. It eliminates middlemen and third parties involved in transactions, reducing the costs associated with those transactions.
- Faster cross-border transactions. Blockchain technology expedites cross-border transactions through peer-to-peer transfers without intermediaries. In contrast, traditional methods often involve lengthy delays and complex procedures.
- Ownership issues. Blockchain can raise questions about ownership and who's responsible when problems arise.
- Infrastructure issues. Questions also come up about whether organizations are willing and capable of investing in the infrastructure needed to build, participate and maintain a blockchain-based network.
- Data challenges. Changing data in a blockchain, should the need arise, would take a lot of work.
- Private keys. Users have to keep track of the private keys that give them access to their assets to avoid losing their money or other investments.
- Storage needs. The need for storage can grow to be very large over time, which risks the loss of nodes if the ledger becomes too large for users to download.
- Security vulnerabilities. Blockchain is susceptible to 51% attacks, which is a specific attack designed to overwhelm other participants in the network and change blocks. Other potential threats include phishing attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and endpoint vulnerabilities.
- Slower performance. Blockchain typically isn't as fast as traditional databases because of the additional operations it performs. Factors such as cryptographic signature verification, reliance on consensus mechanisms and redundancy, where each node verifies and stores transactions, result in lower transaction throughput.
- Avalanche is a smart-contracts platform that lets users build decentralized apps, scale with minimal hardware and launch both private and public blockchains. The platform is also energy-efficient, offering CPU-optimal energy use that helps keep computers cool during operation.
- Chainalysis KYT is a compliance and risk management tool designed to help businesses and financial institutions monitor cryptocurrency transactions in real time. It uses advanced blockchain technology to spot risky and fraudulent activities, helping organizations stay compliant with regulations.
- Ethereum is a widely used, open source, custom-built blockchain platform. It's considered to be an industry-leading choice for enterprise applications. Ethereum enabled the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications, also known as dApps. It has gained significant popularity due to its range of features, flexibility and large developer community. Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, called ether, is used to compensate participants and power the platform.
- Hyperledger Fabric is used in industries such as finance and manufacturing. This open source blockchain platform is designed for permissioned networks, but it can also be used for decentralized hosting and storing applications that use smart contracts. It provides a modular framework to build private, permissionless blockchains tailored to specific business needs.
- IBM Blockchain is an enterprise tool built on the Hyperledger Fabric framework. It offers a secure and immutable ledger to record transactions and track assets. Restricting access and interaction with blockchain data to authorized users enhances the tool's efficiency and trust.
- OpenChain is an open source blockchain platform for organizations that want to manage and preserve digital assets. An administrator of an OpenChain blockchain defines the rules used in the ledger. Users can then exchange value on the ledger by adhering to the rules.
- Ripple is a digital payment network that enables fast and cost-effective cross-border transactions. Unlike traditional blockchains, it uses the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm instead of mining; this lets designated servers validate transactions. Processing takes three to five seconds, and it handles up to 1,500 transactions per second, making it significantly faster than many cryptocurrencies.
- PoW algorithms are used to select a miner for the next block generation.
- Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithms work in asynchronous systems.
- Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithms provide security against fraud.
- PoS algorithms are commonly used as alternatives to PoW.
- Delegated PoS algorithms are used in voting and election processes. They protect against malicious use or centralization in the blockchain.
- Proof of authority algorithms are used in private consortium blockchains where trust is established among participants.
- Proof of elapsed time algorithms are used in permissioned blockchain networks. They rely on a trusted execution environment to ensure nodes wait for a random time before proposing a block. This promotes fairness in block creation.
- Control and ownership. Blockchain uses a shared and synchronized transaction record distributed across a network of computers. Its decentralized nature means no single entity controls the network. In contrast, a centralized ledger is a traditional system with a single source of truth stored in one location, such as on a desktop computer or in the cloud. A central authority, such as a bank or government agency, maintains control of the ledger.
- Trust and transparency. Blockchains, especially public ones, offer increased transparency by recording all transactions on a public ledger that's accessible to all participants. This transparency fosters trust among users because they can independently verify transactions without relying on a central authority. Centralized ledgers limit transparency, as users must trust the central authority to manage the data accurately. This reliance might lead to concerns about data integrity and potential misuse.
- Speed and efficiency. Blockchain transactions often take more time to process because consensus from multiple nodes is required. However, this tradeoff boosts security and reduces the risk of fraud. Centralized systems have streamlined control and fewer nodes involved in validation so they can process transactions faster, but this speed comes at the cost of security and trust.
- Use cases. Blockchain is commonly used in situations that demand high levels of transparency, security and decentralization, such as cryptocurrencies, supply chain management and identity verification. In contrast, centralized ledgers are used in traditional banking and business settings, where a trusted authority validates transactions and maintains records.
- In 2016, the online retail company Overstock.com used blockchain to sell and distribute more than 126,000 company shares. That marked the first time a publicly traded company used blockchain to support stock transactions.
- In 2018, Ticketmaster, the entertainment ticketing software and services company, bought blockchain technology provider Upgraded, which converts traditional tickets into secure interactive digital assets.
- In early 2020, blockchain company Theta Labs partnered with Google Cloud. The partnership allows Google Cloud users to deploy and run nodes from Theta's blockchain network.
- In 2021, NFTs became mainstream, permitting digital assets to be bought, sold and traded on blockchain platforms.

DSA Tutorial - Learn Data Structures and Algorithms
DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)  is the study of organizing data efficiently using data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees, paired with step-by-step procedures (or algorithms) to solve problems effectively. Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed, while algorithms focus on processing this data.
Are you looking to prepare in limited time ?   Try our free course GfG 160 where we have 160 most asked problems along with well written editorials and video explanations. The course also has 90 bonus problems.
Do you wish to learn in a scheduled manner ?   Try our ongoing free course DSA Skillup with weekly topic coverage with mock contests, short notes, daily problems and quizzes.
Hoping you have learned a programming language of your choice, here comes the next stage of the roadmap - Learn about Time and Space Complexities.
Once you have learned basics of a programming language, it is recommended that you learn basic logic building
2. Learn about Complexities
To analyze algorithms, we mainly measure order of growth of time or space taken in terms of input size.  We do this in the worst case scenario in most of the cases. Please refer the below links for a clear understanding of these concepts.
Array is a linear data structure where elements are allocated contiguous memory, allowing for constant-time access.
4. Searching Algorithms
Searching algorithms are used to locate specific data within a large set of data. It helps find a target value within the data. There are various types of searching algorithms, each with its own approach and efficiency.
Sorting algorithms are used to arrange the elements of a list in a specific order, such as numerical or alphabetical. It organizes the items in a systematic way, making it easier to search for and access specific elements.
Hashing is a technique that generates a fixed-size output (hash value) from an input of variable size using mathematical formulas called hash functions. Hashing is commonly used in data structures for efficient searching, insertion and deletion.
7. Two Pointer Technique
In Two Pointer Technique, we typically use two index variables from two corners of an array. We use the two pointer technique for searching a required point or value in an array.
8. Window Sliding Technique
In Window Sliding Technique, we use the result of previous subarray to quickly compute the result of current.
9. Prefix Sum Technique
In Prefix Sum Technique, we compute prefix sums of an array to quickly find results for a subarray.
String is a sequence of characters, typically immutable and have limited set of elements (lower case or all English alphabets).
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition. It is usually used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem.
Matrix is a two-dimensional array of elements, arranged in rows and columns. It is represented as a rectangular grid, with each element at the intersection of a row and column.
Linked list is a linear data structure that stores data in nodes, which are connected by pointers. Unlike arrays, nodes of linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations and can only be accessed sequentially, starting from the head of list.
Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Stacks play an important role in managing function calls, memory, and are widely used in algorithms like stock span problem, next greater element and largest area in a histogram.
Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Queues play an important role in managing tasks or data in order, scheduling and message handling systems.
A deque (double-ended queue) is a data structure that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends efficiently.
Tree is a non-linear, hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a top node called the root and nodes having child nodes. It is widely used in file systems, databases, decision-making algorithms, etc.
Heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps are usually used to implement priority queues, where the smallest or largest element is always at the root of the tree.
Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges(or links)that connect a pair of nodes. Graphs are widely used to represent relationships between entities.
Greedy Algorithm builds up the solution one piece at a time and chooses the next piece which gives the most obvious and immediate benefit i.e., which is the most optimal choice at that moment. So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to the global solutions are best fit for Greedy.
21. Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is a method used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems.
22. Advanced Data Structure and Algorithms
Advanced Data Structures like Trie, Segment Tree, Red-Black Tree and Binary Indexed Tree offer significant performance improvements for specific problem domains. They provide efficient solutions for tasks like fast prefix searches, range queries, dynamic updates, and maintaining balanced data structures, which are crucial for handling large datasets and real-time processing.
Bitwise Algorithms: Operate on individual bits of numbers.
Backtracking Algorithm : Follow Recursion  with the option to revert and traces back if the solution from current point is not feasible.
Divide and conquer:  A strategy to solve problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems, solving those subproblems, and combining the solutions to obtain the final solution.
Branch and Bound : Used in combinatorial optimization problems to systematically search for the best solution. It works by dividing the problem into smaller subproblems, or branches, and then eliminating certain branches based on bounds on the optimal solution. This process continues until the best solution is found or all branches have been explored.
Geometric algorithms are a set of algorithms that solve problems related to shapes, points, lines and polygons.
Randomized algorithms are algorithms that use randomness to solve problems. They make use of random input to achieve their goals, often leading to simpler and more efficient solutions. These algorithms may not product same result but are particularly useful in situations when a probabilistic approach is acceptable.

C Programming Language Tutorial
C is a general-purpose mid-level programming language developed by Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in 1972. It was initially used for the development of UNIX operating system, but it later became popular for a wide range of applications. Today, C remains one of the top three most widely used programming languages.
C is considered as the fundamental language of computer programming. Many modern languages such as C++, Java, Python, and Go derive their syntax from C. So, if you learn C, not only you will have strong grasp of fundamental concepts but also find it easier to learn other programming languages.
Also, C is used in creating almost all of the operating systems and embedded systems. So, if you have interest in low level coding, learning C is mandatory.
This section of the C Tutorial includes basic concepts that build the foundation for writing C programs. It teaches you how to store and output data, perform arithmetic and other operations, control the program flow, etc.
Functions are block of code that performs a specific task. They allow programmers to write modular and reusable code.
Compound Data Types in C
Compound data types are created from primitive data types and provides a different way to use them according to our needs. This section of C tutorial teaches you about the compound data types and how to efficiently organize and process real world data.
Memory Management in C
This section covers the manual memory management in C using pointers. The dynamic memory management in C uses functions like malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free() to manually manage the memory while avoiding errors such as memory leak.
This section teaches you how to work with files in C, including creating, reading, writing, manipulating and deleting files.
Unlike other programming languages that have automatic error handling, In C language error handling is to be manually done by the developers using error-handling methods, debugging strategies, and functions like perror(), strerror(), etc.
Miscellaneous C Concepts
This section explores various essential of C language that do not fit into a single category but play a vital role in C programming and provide advanced functionality to your program.
This section teaches you high-level C programming techniques such as multi-threading, signal handling, socket programming, etc which are used in creating high-performance robust applications and systems.
C vs Other Programming Languages
Let's see where C language stands as compared to other popular programming languages:
No built-in exceptions, manual checks
Supports Exceptions Handling
Built-in exception handling (try-catch)
Built-in exception handling (try-except)
Object-Oriented Support
The below image compares the basic code structure of these 4 programming languages by writing the same Hello World program.
Now that you have a strong foundation in C language, you can explore more advanced topics such as Data structures and Algorithms in C. Keep challenging yourself with our collection of practice problems to further strengthen you understanding of the language:
You can explore advanced topics such as Data structures and Algorithms in C to solve complex problems and you can also contribute to open-source projects, or even start preparing for competitive programming contests to and gain some hands-on experience.

Java Hello World Program
Here is a simple Java program that prints "Hello World".
Java basics form the foundation of your programming journey, covering essential concepts like syntax, data types, variables, loops, and conditionals. Mastering these fundamentals is key to building strong, error-free Java applications:
Java methods are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks and help organize your program. They improve code readability, reduce repetition, and make debugging easier:
Java arrays are containers that store multiple values of the same data type in a single variable. They provide an efficient way to manage and access collections of data using index-based positions:
Java Strings represent sequences of characters and are widely used in text processing. They are immutable, meaning once created, their values cannot be changed:
Java follows the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, which organizes code into classes and objects. Core OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction make Java modular and scalable:
Java interfaces define a contract that classes must follow, specifying method signatures without implementations. They enable abstraction and support multiple inheritance in Java through a clean, structured approach:
Java Collections provide a framework for storing and manipulating groups of objects efficiently. It includes interfaces like List, Set, and Map, along with classes like ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap:
Java Exception Handling
ava Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, ensuring the program runs smoothly without crashing. It uses keywords like try, catch, throw, throws, and finally to manage exceptions:
Java Multithreading allows concurrent execution of two or more threads, enabling efficient CPU utilization and faster program performance. It is commonly used for tasks like parallel processing and responsive applications:
Java File Handling enables programs to create, read, write, and manipulate files stored on the system. It uses classes from the java.io and java.nio packages for efficient file operations:
Java Streams and Lambda Expressions
Java Streams and Lambda Expressions simplify data processing by enabling functional-style operations on collections. Lambdas provide concise syntax for anonymous functions, while Streams allow efficient filtering, mapping, and reduction of data:
Java IO (Input/Output) provides a set of classes and streams to read and write data from various sources like files, consoles, and network connections. It is part of the java.io package and supports both byte and character streams:
Java Synchronization is used to control access to shared resources in multithreaded environments. It ensures that only one thread can access a critical section at a time, preventing data inconsistency:
Java Regex (Regular Expressions) allows pattern matching and text manipulation using the java.util.regex package. It is powerful for validating, searching, and replacing strings based on specific patterns:
Java Networking enables communication between devices over a network using classes from the java.net package. It supports protocols like TCP and UDP for building client-server applications and data exchange:
Java Database Connectivity(JDBC)
Java Memory Allocation
Java Memory Allocation refers to how memory is assigned to variables, objects, and classes during program execution. It involves stack and heap memory, with the JVM managing allocation and garbage collection automatically:
