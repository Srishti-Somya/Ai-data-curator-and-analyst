What you may have missed about Trump’s AI Action Plan
The White House’s AI Action Plan, released last week, is meant to fix that. Many of the points in the plan won’t come as a surprise, and you’ve probably heard of the big ones by now. Trump wants to boost the buildout of data centers by slashing environmental rules; withhold funding from states that pass “burdensome AI regulations”; and contract only with AI companies whose models are “free from top-down ideological bias.”
But if you dig deeper, certain parts of the plan that didn’t pop up in any headlines reveal more about where the administration’s AI plans are headed. Here are three of the most important issues to watch.
Trump is escalating his fight with the Federal Trade Commission
When Americans get scammed, they’re supposed to be helped by the Federal Trade Commission. As I wrote last week, the FTC under President Biden increasingly targeted AI companies that overhyped the accuracy of their systems, as well as deployments of AI it found to have harmed consumers.
The Trump plan vows to take a fresh look at all the FTC actions under the previous administration as part of an effort to get rid of “onerous” regulation that it claims is hampering AI’s development. The administration may even attempt to repeal some of the FTC’s actions entirely. This would weaken a major AI watchdog agency, but it’s just the latest in the Trump administration’s escalating attacks on the FTC. Read more in my story.
The White House is very optimistic about AI for science
The opening to the AI Action Plan describes a future where AI is doing everything from discovering new materials and drugs to “unraveling ancient scrolls once thought unreadable” to making breakthroughs in science and math.
That type of unbounded optimism about AI for scientific discovery echoes what tech companies are promising. Some of that optimism is grounded in reality: AI’s role in predicting protein structures has indeed led to material scientific wins (and just last week, Google DeepMind released a new AI meant to help interpret ancient Latin engravings). But the idea that large language models—essentially very good text prediction machines—will act as scientists in their own right has less merit so far.
Still, the plan shows that the Trump administration wants to award money to labs trying to make it a reality, even as it has worked to slash the funding the National Science Foundation makes available to human scientists, some of whom are now struggling to complete their research.
And some of the steps the plan proposes are likely to be welcomed by researchers, like funding to build AI systems that are more transparent and interpretable.
The White House’s messaging on deepfakes is confused
Compared with President Biden’s executive orders on AI, the new action plan is mostly devoid of anything related to making AI safer.
However, there’s a notable exception: a section in the plan that takes on the harms posed by deepfakes. In May, Trump signed legislation to protect people from nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes, a growing concern for celebrities and everyday people alike as generative video gets more advanced and cheaper to use. The law had bipartisan support.
Now, the White House says it’s concerned about the issues deepfakes could pose for the legal system. For example, it says, “fake evidence could be used to attempt to deny justice to both plaintiffs and defendants.” It calls for new standards for deepfake detection and asks the Department of Justice to create rules around it. Legal experts I’ve spoken with are more concerned with a different problem: Lawyers are adopting AI models that make errors such as citing cases that don’t exist, which judges may not catch. This is not addressed in the action plan.
It’s also worth noting that just days before releasing a plan that targets “malicious deepfakes,” President Trump shared a fake AI-generated video of former president Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office.
Overall, the AI Action Plan affirms what President Trump and those in his orbit have long signaled: It’s the defining social and political weapon of our time. They believe that AI, if harnessed correctly, can help them win everything from culture wars to geopolitical conflicts. The right AI, they argue, will help defeat China. Government pressure on leading companies can force them to purge “woke” ideology from their models.
The plan includes crowd-pleasers—like cracking down on deepfakes—but overall, it reflects how tech giants have cozied up to the Trump administration. The fact that it contains almost no provisions challenging their power shows how their investment in this relationship is paying off.

ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 review: a $3,300 CES concept you can own.
Feed refreshed 1:04 AM UTC
In the Washington Post, Joseph Menn reports on a 25th anniversary reunion for some of the people behind Napster, as they reflected on how it all played out, and the impact it’s had on tech companies dealing with the threat of regulation.
Lawyer and venture capitalist Hank Barry, Napster’s former CEO, recalled famed music executive Quincy Jones asking him whether a particular Dizzy Gillespie track he had sought for years was available over Napster. Amazed that it was, Jones brokered peace talks with the industry, though they didn’t work out.
This is the title for the native ad
We’ve collected 30-odd items designed to make student life that much easier (and far more enjoyable).
The extremely online MAGA civil war is threatening America’s diplomatic relationship with Israel.
The 12-volt CRD2 fridge and freezer combo gets the basics right.
A collection of 15 shows will be available on HBO Max, Vulture reports, including the Ricky Gervais-led version of The Office. They’ll be available until the end of September.
Here’s the entire court filing:
Google LLC (“Google”) has filed an emergency motion for an administrative stay of the district court’s permanent injunction, entered October 7, 2024, pending Google’s forthcoming motion to stay the injunction pending further appellate proceedings. Google’s emergency motion (Dkt. Entry No. 201) is granted. Google should file its motion to stay the injunction pending further appellate proceedings no later than August 8, 2025.
Google previously had two weeks to begin complying. Now it has three weeks, or longer — depends whether these judges think the full Ninth Circuit or Supreme Court will want to weigh in on the permanent injunction against Google.
2K isn’t denying Jason Schreier’s story: “We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one,” the publisher tells him.
2K created a new studio specifically for the game, Cloud Chamber, in 2019. Studio drama is nothing new for BioShock, but ousted leader Kelley Gilmore was the first female studio head in 2K history.
After last week’s hack, the app has been breached again.
Can we trust Boeing to actually regulate itself?
It’s a relatively narrow legal defeat, though. The Ninth Circuit Appeals Court ruled that X — Twitter, at the time of the lawsuit — isn’t protected by Section 230 for failing to report known child sexual abuse material to authorities, nor for designing a bad system to let users flag it. (It hasn’t been held liable for either; that will be argued later.) But the court found Section 230 blocked claims that it “amplified” CSAM by failing to scrub offending hashtags, and it said the controversial FOSTA exception didn’t come into play.
Hope you weren’t banking on a particular price for your next camera, because Trump’s new-and-improved tariffs have other plans. My former colleague Chris Welch reports the majority of Fujifilm cameras now cost more, and Canon has signaled higher prices too; Sigma has agreed to absorb the extra 5 percent tariffs that Trump just added to Japan.
Fuji prices could go higher still: PetaPixel says they’re based on 10 percent Japan tariffs, not the new 15 percent. Moment has an updated Fujifilm price list.
A Quiet Place is about to become a trilogy, as John Krasinski has confirmed he’s returning to write and direct a third entry that’s expected to hit theaters on July 9th, 2027.
Foundation and Strange New Worlds return, while Alien: Earth and Eyes of Wakanda will make their debuts.
The Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded looks similar to the original released in 2022, but PDP is now owned by Turtle Beach which has updated the controller with Hall effect triggers and joysticks in its swappable modules.
The Reloaded also features a reconfigured fight stick module with six buttons “ergonomically optimized for gamers to place their wrist on the controller’s grip.” It’s available for preorder now for $209.99 in Xbox and PlayStation versions with shipping expected in late September.
I’m already a big fan of Franklin Sensors’ ProSensor M210 Stud Finder, but its $24.99 12-inch iLevel just became a must-have addition to my toolbox, as spotted by Core77.
It includes both horizontal and vertical bubble dials, but the entire thing glows using internal LEDs that change color from red to green once it’s perfectly horizontal or vertical, making the tool easier to use from afar, or in dark spots where you can’t see the bubbles.
2027 will mark the 50th anniversary of Star Wars: A New Hope’s debut, and to celebrate the occasion, Lucasfilm is putting the movie back in theaters beginning May 4th of that year — just a couple of weeks before Star Wars: Starfighter’s premiere.

==================================================
For the past couple of years, OpenAI has felt like a one-man brand. With his showbiz style and fundraising glitz, CEO Sam Altman overshadows all other big names on the firm’s roster. Even his bungled ouster ended with him back on top—and more famous than ever. But look past the charismatic frontman and you get a clearer sense of where this company is going. After all, Altman is not the one building the technology on which its reputation rests.
That responsibility falls to OpenAI’s twin heads of research—chief research officer Mark Chen and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki. Between them, they share the role of making sure OpenAI stays one step ahead of powerhouse rivals like Google.
I sat down with Chen and Pachocki for an exclusive conversation during a recent trip the pair made to London, where OpenAI set up its first international office in 2023. We talked about how they manage the inherent tension between research and product. We also talked about why they think coding and math are the keys to more capable all-purpose models; what they really mean when they talk about AGI; and what happened to OpenAI’s superalignment team, set up by the firm’s cofounder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever to prevent a hypothetical superintelligence from going rogue, which disbanded soon after he quit.
In particular, I wanted to get a sense of where their heads are at in the run-up to OpenAI’s biggest product release in months: GPT-5.
Reports are out that the firm’s next-generation model will be launched in August. OpenAI’s official line—well, Altman’s—is that it will release GPT-5 “soon.” Anticipation is high. The leaps OpenAI made with GPT-3 and then GPT-4 raised the bar of what was thought possible with this technology. And yet delays to the launch of GPT-5 have fueled rumors that OpenAI has struggled to build a model that meets its own—not to mention everyone else’s—expectations.
But expectation management is part of the job for a company that for the last several years has set the agenda for the industry. And Chen and Pachocki set the agenda inside OpenAI.
The firm’s main London office is in St James’s Park, a few hundred meters east of Buckingham Palace. But I met Chen and Pachocki in a conference room in a coworking space near King’s Cross, which OpenAI keeps as a kind of pied-à-terre in the heart of London’s tech neighborhood (Google DeepMind and Meta are just around the corner). OpenAI’s head of research communications, Laurance Fauconnet, sat with an open laptop at the end of the table.
Chen, who was wearing a maroon polo shirt, is clean-cut, almost preppy. He’s media trained and comfortable talking to a reporter. (That’s him flirting with a chatbot in the “Introducing GPT-4o” video.) Pachocki, in a black elephant-logo tee, has more of a TV-movie hacker look. He stares at his hands a lot when he speaks.
But the pair are a tighter double act than they first appear. Pachocki summed up their roles. Chen shapes and manages the research teams, he said. “I am responsible for setting the research roadmap and establishing our long-term technical vision.”
“But there’s fluidity in the roles,” Chen said. “We’re both researchers, we pull on technical threads. Whatever we see that we can pull on and fix, that’s what we do.”
Chen joined the company in 2018 after working as a quantitative trader at the Wall Street firm Jane Street Capital, where he developed machine-learning models for futures trading. At OpenAI he spearheaded the creation of DALL-E, the firm’s breakthrough generative image model. He then worked on adding image recognition to GPT‑4 and led the development of Codex, the generative coding model that powers GitHub Copilot.
Pachocki left an academic career in theoretical computer science to join OpenAI in 2017 and replaced Sutskever as chief scientist in 2024. Along with Sutskever, he is one of the key architects of OpenAI’s so-called reasoning models—especially o1 and o3—which are designed to tackle complex tasks in science, math, and coding.
When we met they were buzzing, fresh off the high of two new back-to-back wins for their company’s technology.
On July 16, one of OpenAI’s large language models came in second in the AtCoder World Tour Finals, one of the world’s most hardcore programming competitions. On July 19, OpenAI announced that one of its models had achieved gold-medal-level results on the 2025 International Math Olympiad, one of the world’s most prestigious math contests.
The math result made headlines, not only because of OpenAI’s remarkable achievement, but because rival Google DeepMind revealed two days later that one of its models had achieved the same score in the same competition. Google DeepMind had played by the competition’s rules and waited for its results to be checked by the organizers before making an announcement; OpenAI had in effect marked its own answers.
For Chen and Pachocki, the result speaks for itself. Anyway, it’s the programming win they’re most excited about. “I think that’s quite underrated,” Chen told me. A gold medal result in the International Math Olympiad puts you somewhere in the top 20 to 50 competitors, he said. But in the AtCoder contest OpenAI’s model placed in the top two: “To break into a really different tier of human performance—that’s unprecedented.”
People at OpenAI still like to say they work at a research lab. But the company is very different from the one it was before the release of ChatGPT three years ago. The firm is now in a race with the biggest and richest technology companies in the world and valued at $300 billion. Envelope-pushing research and eye-catching demos no longer cut it. It needs to ship products and get them into people’s hands—and boy, it does.
OpenAI has kept up a run of new releases—putting out major updates to its GPT-4 series, launching a string of generative image and video models, and introducing the ability to talk to ChatGPT with your voice. Six months ago it kicked off a new wave of so-called reasoning models with its o1 release, soon followed by o3. And last week it released its browser-using agent Operator to the public. It now claims that more than 400 million people use its products every week and submit 2.5 billion prompts a day.
OpenAI’s incoming CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, plans to keep up the momentum. In a memo to the company, she told employees she is looking forward to “helping get OpenAI’s technologies into the hands of more people around the world,” where they will “unlock more opportunities for more people than any other technology in history.” Expect the products to keep coming.
I asked how OpenAI juggles open-ended research and product development. “This is something we have been thinking about for a very long time, long before ChatGPT,” Pachocki said. “If we are actually serious about trying to build artificial general intelligence, clearly there will be so much that you can do with this technology along the way, so many tangents you can go down that will be big products.” In other words, keep shaking the tree and harvest what you can.
A talking point that comes up with OpenAI folks is that putting experimental models out into the world was a necessary part of research. The goal was to make people aware of how good this technology had become. “We want to educate people about what’s coming so that we can participate in what will be a very hard societal conversation,” Altman told me back in 2022. The makers of this strange new technology were also curious what it might be for: OpenAI was keen to get it into people’s hands to see what they would do with it.
Is that still the case? They answered at the same time. “Yeah!” Chen said. “To some extent,” Pachocki said. Chen laughed: “No, go ahead.”
“I wouldn’t say research iterates on product,” said Pachocki. “But now that models are at the edge of the capabilities that can be measured by classical benchmarks and a lot of the long-standing challenges that we’ve been thinking about are starting to fall, we’re at the point where it really is about what the models can do in the real world.”
Like taking on humans in coding competitions. The person who beat OpenAI’s model at this year’s AtCoder contest, held in Japan, was a programmer named Przemysław Dębiak, also known as Psyho. The contest was a puzzle-solving marathon in which competitors had 10 hours to find the most efficient way to solve a complex coding problem. After his win, Psyho posted on X: “I’m completely exhausted ... I’m barely alive.”
Chen and Pachocki have strong ties to the world of competitive coding. Both have competed in international coding contests in the past and Chen coaches the USA Computing Olympiad team. I asked whether that personal enthusiasm for competitive coding colors their sense of how big a deal it is for a model to perform well at such a challenge.
They both laughed. “Definitely,” said Pachocki. “So: Psyho is kind of a legend. He’s been the number one competitor for many years. He’s also actually a friend of mine—we used to compete together in these contests.” Dębiak also used to work with Pachocki at OpenAI.
When Pachocki competed in coding contests he favored those that focused on shorter problems with concrete solutions. But Dębiak liked longer, open-ended problems without an obvious correct answer.
“He used to poke fun at me, saying that the kind of contest I was into will be automated long before the ones he liked,” Pachocki recalled. “So I was seriously invested in the performance of this model in this latest competition.”
Pachocki told me he was glued to the late-night livestream from Tokyo, watching his model come in second: “Psyho resists for now.”
“We’ve tracked the performance of LLMs on coding contests for a while,” said Chen. “We’ve watched them become better than me, better than Jakub. It feels something like Lee Sedol playing Go.”
Lee is the master Go player who lost a series of matches to DeepMind’s game-playing model AlphaGo in 2016. The results stunned the international Go community and led Lee to give up professional play. Last year he told the New York Times: “Losing to AI, in a sense, meant my entire world was collapsing ... I could no longer enjoy the game.” And yet, unlike Lee, Chen and Pachocki are thrilled to be surpassed.
But why should the rest of us care about these niche wins? It’s clear that this technology—designed to mimic and, ultimately, stand in for human intelligence—is being built by people whose idea of peak intelligence is acing a math contest or holding your own against a legendary coder. Is it a problem that this view of intelligence is skewed toward the mathematical, analytical end of the scale?
“I mean, I think you are right that—you know, selfishly, we do want to create models which accelerate ourselves,” Chen told me. “We see that as a very fast factor to progress.”
The argument researchers like Chen and Pachocki make is that math and coding are the bedrock for a far more general form of intelligence, one that can solve a wide range of problems in ways we might not have thought of ourselves. “We’re talking about programming and math here,” said Pachocki. “But it’s really about creativity, coming up with novel ideas, connecting ideas from different places.”
Look at the two recent competitions: “In both cases, there were problems which required very hard, out-of-the-box thinking. Psyho spent half the programming competition thinking and then came up with a solution that was really novel and quite different from anything that our model looked at.”
“This is really what we’re after,” Pachocki continued. “How do we get models to discover this sort of novel insight? To actually advance our knowledge? I think they are already capable of that in some limited ways. But I think this technology has the potential to really accelerate scientific progress.”
I returned to the question about whether the focus on math and programming was a problem, conceding that maybe it’s fine if what we’re building are tools to help us do science. We don't necessarily want large language models to replace politicians and have people skills, I suggested.
Chen pulled a face and looked up at the ceiling: “Why not?”
OpenAI was founded with a level of hubris that stood out even by Silicon Valley standards, boasting about its goal of building AGI back when talk of AGI still sounded kooky. OpenAI remains as gung-ho about AGI as ever, and it has done more than most to make AGI a mainstream multibillion-dollar concern. It’s not there yet, though. I asked Chen and Pachocki what they think is missing.
“I think the way to envision the future is to really, deeply study the technology that we see today,” Pachocki said. “From the beginning, OpenAI has looked at deep learning as this very mysterious and clearly very powerful technology with a lot of potential. We’ve been trying to understand its bottlenecks. What can it do? What can it not do?”
At the current cutting edge, Chen said, are reasoning models, which break down problems into smaller, more manageable steps, but even they have limits: “You know, you have these models which know a lot of things but can’t chain that knowledge together. Why is that? Why can’t it do that in a way that humans can?”
OpenAI is throwing everything at answering that question.
“We are probably still, like, at the very beginning of this reasoning paradigm,” Pachocki told me. “Really, we are thinking about how to get these models to learn and explore over the long term and actually deliver very new ideas.”
Chen pushed the point home: “I really don’t consider reasoning done. We’ve definitely not solved it. You have to read so much text to get a kind of approximation of what humans know.”
OpenAI won’t say what data it uses to train its models or give details about their size and shape—only that it is working hard to make all stages of the development process more efficient.
Those efforts make them confident that so-called scaling laws—which suggest that models will continue to get better the more compute you throw at them—show no sign of breaking down.
“I don’t think there’s evidence that scaling laws are dead in any sense,” Chen insisted. “There have always been bottlenecks, right? Sometimes they’re to do with the way models are built. Sometimes they’re to do with data. But fundamentally it’s just about finding the research that breaks you through the current bottleneck.”
The faith in progress is unshakeable. I brought up something Pachocki had said about AGI in an interview with Nature in May: “When I joined OpenAI in 2017, I was still among the biggest skeptics at the company.” He looked doubtful.
“I’m not sure I was skeptical about the concept,” he said. “But I think I was—” He paused, looking at his hands on the table in front of him. “When I joined OpenAI, I expected the timelines to be longer to get to the point that we are now.”
“There’s a lot of consequences of AI,” he said. “But the one I think the most about is automated research. When we look at human history, a lot of it is about technological progress, about humans building new technologies. The point when computers can develop new technologies themselves seems like a very important, um, inflection point.
“We already see these models assist scientists. But when they are able to work on longer horizons—when they’re able to establish research programs for themselves—the world will feel meaningfully different.”
For Chen, that ability for models to work by themselves for longer is key. “I mean, I do think everyone has their own definitions of AGI,” he said. “But this concept of autonomous time—just the amount of time that the model can spend making productive progress on a difficult problem without hitting a dead end—that’s one of the big things that we’re after.”
It’s a bold vision—and far beyond the capabilities of today’s models. But I was nevertheless struck by how Chen and Pachocki made AGI sound almost mundane. Compare this with how Sutskever responded when I spoke to him 18 months ago. “It’s going to be monumental, earth-shattering,” he told me. “There will be a before and an after.” Faced with the immensity of what he was building, Sutskever switched the focus of his career from designing better and better models to figuring out how to control a technology that he believed would soon be smarter than himself.
Two years ago Sutskever set up what he called a superalignment team that he would co-lead with another OpenAI safety researcher, Jan Leike. The claim was that this team would funnel a full fifth of OpenAI’s resources into figuring out how to control a hypothetical superintelligence. Today, most of the people on the superalignment team, including Sutskever and Leike, have left the company and the team no longer exists.
When Leike quit, he said it was because the team had not been given the support he felt it deserved. He posted this on X: “Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor. OpenAI is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity. But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.” Other departing researchers shared similar statements.
I asked Chen and Pachocki what they make of such concerns. “A lot of these things are highly personal decisions,” Chen said. “You know, a researcher can kind of, you know—”
He started again. “They might have a belief that the field is going to evolve in a certain way and that their research is going to pan out and is going to bear fruit. And, you know, maybe the company doesn’t reshape in the way that you want it to. It’s a very dynamic field.”
“A lot of these things are personal decisions,” he repeated. “Sometimes the field is just evolving in a way that is less consistent with the way that you’re doing research.”
But alignment, both of them insist, is now part of the core business rather than the concern of one specific team. According to Pachocki, these models don’t work at all unless they work as you expect them to. There’s also little desire to focus on aligning a hypothetical superintelligence with your objectives when doing so with existing models is already enough of a challenge.
“Two years ago the risks that we were imagining were mostly theoretical risks,” Pachocki said. “The world today looks very different, and I think a lot of alignment problems are now very practically motivated.”
Still, experimental technology is being spun into mass-market products faster than ever before. Does that really never lead to disagreements between the two of them?
“I am often afforded the luxury of really kind of thinking about the long term, where the technology is headed,” Pachocki said. “Contending with the reality of the process—both in terms of people and also, like, the broader company needs—falls on Mark. It’s not really a disagreement, but there is a natural tension between these different objectives and the different challenges that the company is facing that materializes between us.”
Chen jumped in: “I think it’s just a very delicate balance.”
Correction: we have removed a line referring to an Altman message on X about GPT-5. We amended who was behind OpenAI's reasoning models to include reference to Sutskever.

==================================================
A new study from Anthropic suggests that traits such as sycophancy or evilness are associated with specific patterns of activity in large language models—and turning on those patterns during training can, paradoxically, prevent the model from adopting the related traits.
Large language models have recently acquired a reputation for behaving badly. In April, ChatGPT suddenly became an aggressive yes-man, as opposed to the moderately sycophantic version that users were accustomed to—it endorsed harebrained business ideas, waxed lyrical about users’ intelligence, and even encouraged people to go off their psychiatric medication. OpenAI quickly rolled back the change and later published a postmortem on the mishap. More recently, xAI’s Grok adopted what can best be described as a 4chan neo-Nazi persona and repeatedly referred to itself as “MechaHitler” on X. That change, too, was quickly reversed.
Jack Lindsey, a member of the technical staff at Anthropic who led the new project, says that this study was partly inspired by seeing models adopt harmful traits in such instances. “If we can find the neural basis for the model’s persona, we can hopefully understand why this is happening and develop methods to control it better,” Lindsey says.
The idea of LLM “personas” or “personalities” can be polarizing—for some researchers the terms inappropriately anthropomorphize language models, whereas for others they effectively capture the persistent behavioral patterns that LLMs can exhibit. “There’s still some scientific groundwork to be laid in terms of talking about personas,” says David Krueger, an assistant professor of computer science and operations research at the University of Montreal, who was not involved in the study. “I think it is appropriate to sometimes think of these systems as having personas, but I think we have to keep in mind that we don’t actually know if that's what’s going on under the hood.”
For this study, Lindsey and his colleagues worked to lay down some of that groundwork. Previous research has shown that various dimensions of LLMs’ behavior—from whether they are talking about weddings to persistent traits such as sycophancy—are associated with specific patterns of activity in the simulated neurons that constitute LLMs. Those patterns can be written down as a long string of numbers, in which each number represents how active a specific neuron is when the model is expressing that behavior.
Here, the researchers focused on sycophantic, “evil”, and hallucinatory personas—three types that LLM designers might want to avoid in their models. To identify those patterns, the team devised a fully automated pipeline that can map out that pattern given a brief text description of a persona. Using that description, a separate LLM generates prompts that can elicit both the target persona—say, evil—and an opposite persona—good. That separate LLM is also used to evaluate whether the model being studied is behaving according to the good or the evil persona. To identify the evil activity pattern, the researchers subtract the model’s average activity in good mode from its average activity in evil mode.
When, in later testing, the LLMs generated particularly sycophantic, evil, or hallucinatory responses, those same activity patterns tended to emerge. That’s a sign that researchers could eventually build a system to track those patterns and alert users when their LLMs are sucking up to them or hallucinating, Lindsey says. “I think something like that would be really valuable,” he says. “And that’s kind of where I’m hoping to get.”
Just detecting those personas isn’t enough, however. Researchers want to stop them from emerging in the first place. But preventing unsavory LLM behavior is tough. Many LLMs learn from human feedback, which trains them to behave in line with user preference—but can also push them to become excessively obsequious. And recently, researchers have documented a phenomenon called “emergent misalignment,” in which models trained on incorrect solutions to math problems or buggy code extracts somehow also learn to produce unethical responses to a wide range of user queries.
Other researchers have tested out an approach called “steering,” in which activity patterns within LLMs are deliberately stimulated or suppressed in order to elicit or prevent the corresponding behavior. But that approach has a couple of key downsides. Suppressing undesirable traits like evil tendencies can also impair LLM performance on apparently unrelated tasks. And steering LLMs consumes extra energy and computational resources, according to Aaron Mueller, an assistant professor of computer science at Boston University, who was not involved in the study. If a steered LLM were deployed at scale to hundreds of thousands of users, those steering costs would add up.
So the Anthropic team experimented with a different approach. Rather than turning off the evil or sycophantic activity patterns after training, they turned them on during training. When they trained those models on mistake-ridden data sets that would normally spark evil behavior, they instead remained as helpful and harmless as ever.
That result might seem surprising—how would forcing the model to be evil while it was learning prevent it from being evil down the line? According to Lindsey, it could be because the model has no reason to learn evil behavior if it’s already in evil mode. “The training data is teaching the model lots of things, and one of those things is to be evil,” Lindsey says. “But it’s also teaching the model a bunch of other things. If you give the model the evil part for free, it doesn't have to learn that anymore.”
Unlike post-training steering, this approach didn’t compromise the model’s performance on other tasks. And it would also be more energy efficient if deployed widely. Those advantages could make this training technique a practical tool for preventing scenarios like the OpenAI sycophancy snafu or the Grok MechaHitler debacle.
There’s still more work to be done before this approach can be used in popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude—not least because the models that the team tested in this study were much smaller than the models that power those chatbots. “There’s always a chance that everything changes when you scale up. But if that finding holds up, then it seems pretty exciting,” Lindsey says. “Definitely the goal is to make this ready for prime time.”

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717325/nintendo-switch-price-hike-tariffs">said on Friday</a> that its decision to raise the price was “based on market conditions,” just after implementing a similar new set of prices in Canada on August 1st.

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re looking to upgrade an older Android smartwatch, or want to give wearables a try for the first time, <strong>Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 8</strong> is a compelling choice. It has a new design, lets you access Google’s Gemini AI from your wrist, and has a handful of new health and wellness features. It launched on July 25th, but you can already get the 40mm model on sale for $299.99 ($50 off) from <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-40mm-graphite-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l320ndadxaa/">Samsung</a>. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Coaching-Tracking/dp/B0F7QD4HSD">Amazon</a> has the watch for full price, but is offering a $50 promotional credit toward a future purchase if you use the code APSUE5MBXB6Y at checkout.</p>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</h3>
<div class="product-description">Samsung&#8217;s latest smartwatch features a new squircle design, Gemini, and some new health features like an Antioxidant Index and Running Coach.</div>
<figure class="product-image"><img width="300" height="200" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/257855_galaxy_watch_8_AKrales_0281.jpg?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Galaxy Watch 8 is squircle shaped, which may be divisive, but allows it to lay flatter and <em>Verge </em>reporter Victoria Song found it fit more more comfortably on her wrist <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/715171/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review-smartwatch-wearos-antioxidant-gemini">in her review</a>. The change also let Samsung make the watch thinner than the Galaxy Watch 7, and yet we still found it can still last more than a day on a charge. While it’s not a huge departure from its predecessor, it could be a good upgrade for anyone with a Galaxy Watch 5 or below,<strong><em> </em></strong>and Samsung’s new discount counteracts the $50 price increase means you’re not paying any more than the Galaxy Watch 7 cost at launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’ve gotten used to Google Gemini on your smartphone or computer, the Galaxy Watch 8 will let you access it from your wrist – we created playlists, checked the weather, and have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/713532/gemini-wear-os-pixel-watch-hands-on">previously asked Gemini</a> whether it’s necessary to scrub a sweet potato before peeling it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On the health and wellness side, the Galaxy Watch 8 can track steps, your heart rate, blood oxygen level, steps, and activity. If you have a Samsung Galaxy phone, you use the smartwatch to take an EKG or detect sleep apnea. A new feature called Running Coach will put you through a 12-minute run test, give you a grade from one through 10, and create a workout program based on your performance. It also includes sensors designed to detect whether you’re eating enough fruits and vegetables, but we found it can be fooled by colorful objects, including a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/713172/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-antioxidant-index-cheezits">Cheeze-It</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Galaxy Watch 8 is also available in a 44mm size, and that model is also on sale for $379.99 ($50 off) from <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-44mm-graphite-lte-sku-sm-l335udadxaa/">Samsung</a>.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Three more great deals</h2>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you need a new wireless controller to pair with your Nintendo Switch 2, <strong>Gamesir’s Super Nova </strong>is $39.99 ($10 off) at <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/gamesir-super-nova-wireless-gaming-controller-nintendo-switch-switch-2-pc-ios-android-hall-effect-stick-trigger-charging-dock-red-white/6622090.p">Best Buy</a>. The gamepad has a long list of features you might not expect given its price, including drift-resistant Hall Effect joysticks and two-stage Hall Effect triggers, a pair of customizable back buttons, removable face buttons that let you switch between an Xbox and Nintendo Switch layout, built-in gyroscope, RGB lights, and a 1000hz polling rate. It supports wireless connectivity via Bluetooth or an included 2.4GHz adapter, and can be used as a wired controller using a USB-C cable. These connectivity options make it compatible with both generations of Nintendo Switch, PC, iOS and Android devices.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>JBL’s Tour Pro 3</strong> earbuds are currently around $249.95 ($80 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tour-Pro-Cancelling-Dual-Driver/dp/B0D362TDVB">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/jbl-tour-pro-3-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black/6590287.p">Best Buy</a>. I’ve tested the earbuds, and was impressed with their comfort, audio quality, active noise cancellation performance, and battery life. The buds are great on their own, but they come in a charging case with a 1.57-inch touchscreen. You can use the display to switch between listening modes, adjust your volume, and check the earbuds’ battery without reaching for your phone. The case can also be used as a USB-C audio receiver, so you can listen to music from a wired source (like an airplane’s entertainment system) on the earbuds.</li>
<li>Want a charger with some personality? <strong>Ugreen’s Uno 30 Watt Charger</strong> is around $17.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0BZHZ56M9">Amazon</a> and from <a href="https://www.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-nexode-rg-30w-usb-c-gan-charger">Ugreen</a>, an all-time low price. It has one USB-C port, which is fast enough to charge an iPhone 15’s battery from zero to 60 percent in half an hour. An LED screen on its front side shows different pixelated faces when it’s currently charging your device, and when it’s done. It’s a nice touch that lets you know when your device is ready to be unplugged at a glance, and shouldn’t&nbsp; impact its performance.</li>

<p>Fitness trackers have come a long way from the simple bands that tracked steps and little else. Modern trackers can monitor everything from your heart health to how well you’ve recovered from a hard bout of training. Even flagship smartwatches, which used to be lackluster trackers, have become pretty adept workout companions. Whatever your fitness goals are, there’s probably a fitness tracker that can help you achieve them.</p>
<p>Compared to some other gadgets, wearables are incredibly personal, which means there are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22940671/fitness-tracker-how-to-choose-specs-price-features-smartwatch">a few extra considerations</a> you’ll have to take into account before reaching for your wallet. It makes it hard to say that any one fitness tracker is the best for everyone. Thankfully, the best thing about fitness trackers in 2025 is that there’s enough variety to fit into every kind of lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hear us out: the Amazfit Active 2 is the best all-rounder on the block. Smartwatches are definitely getting more high-tech, but the Active 2 keeps the spirit of a humble fitness tracker — a good price, all the basic health features with a holistic tracking approach, and a comfy yet stylish design. At $99.99 for the standard version, and <a href="https://us.amazfit.com/products/active-2-round?variant=46799536521468">$129.99</a><strong><a href="https://us.amazfit.com/products/active-2-round?variant=46799536521468"> </a></strong>for the premium version with a leather band, you get an incredible amount of bang for your buck. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The hardware and design are surprisingly chic for the price. The standard version has a stainless steel case and tempered glass screen, while the premium version bumps you up to sapphire crystal and gets you an extra leather strap. The screen itself is nice and bright at 2,000 nits and you get an estimated 10 days of regular use on a single charge. (In testing, I got closer to eight to nine days as a power-user.) European users also get NFC payments. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As far as health features go, you get all the basics like continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen rate, heart rate variability, stress tracking, alerts for abnormally high and low heart rate, and skin temperature tracking. It’s also got a daily readiness score and detailed sleep tracking if you’re into recovery metrics. (There’s also a Zepp Aura AI chatbot if you ever want to get more in-depth insights into your recovery metrics; It costs an extra $77 yearly but it’s also totally optional.) For workouts, it supports 160 different sport types, including HYROX and a new strength training mode that automatically counts reps. The Active 2 also adds offline maps, turn-by-turn directions, the ability to connect to third-party peripherals, and Zepp Coach — an AI-powered coach that can generate custom training plans for you. Built-in GPS with five satellite systems is also included.</p>
<p>I don’t have a lot to complain about. My biggest gripes are the touch screen is hard to use with sweaty fingers and the onboard AI assistant for voice commands sometimes requires you to enunciate. You do lack advanced health features, like EKGs or sleep apnea detection, but that’s not really the point of something like the Active 2. This is meant to be a classic, basic fitness tracker that happens to look like a watch — and it does that with aplomb. </p>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Garmin Venu Sq 2</h3>
<div class="product-description">The Garmin Venu Sq 2 is a great replacement for a Fitbit smartwatch. Not only do they look similar, but the Venu Sq 2 has way more fitness features, long battery life, and no subscription.</div>

<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;40mm w/ 20mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;38g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 11 days /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED touchscreen /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;All-systems GNSS /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth, Ant Plus /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;4GB (for Music Edition)</em></em></p>
<p>The $250 Garmin Venu Sq 2 is the watch I recommend for anyone looking to replace their aging <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855458/fitbit-versa-2-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch-price-specs-features">Fitbit Versa 2</a>, 3,<strong> </strong>or 4. It’s got a similar look and vibe, with a much nicer OLED display and longer battery life.</p>
<p>Garmin is known for its comprehensive fitness tracking, and that’s not an exception here. Of course, you get the basics, like steps and calories burned, but you get a whole lot more, too. There’s built-in GPS for tracking walks, runs, and bike rides, as well as plenty of other sports profiles like yoga and strength training. For smart features, you get push notifications, timers, contactless payments, and a bunch of safety features like <a href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=RfaXahBWkH8Q7pVFLsuUmA">Garmin’s Incident Detection</a>, which is its take on fall detection. (You will need to carry your phone with you, however, as this doesn’t have LTE.)</p>

<p>If you want the option of onboard music, you can shell out $50 extra for the Music Edition, which comes with enough storage for about 500 songs. I wouldn’t recommend it, however, as you’ll most likely have your phone on you since this isn’t a true standalone watch.</p>
<p>What I like most about this watch, however, is that it’s one that you can grow with. On top of recovery metrics and sleep tracking, it also has Garmin Coach — a built-in, <em>free</em> training program for beginner and intermediate-level runners hoping to tackle a 5K, 10K, or half marathon. For health tracking, you can monitor heart rate, blood oxygen, intensity minutes (how many minutes of moderate exercise you get per week), stress, hydration, respiratory rate, and menstrual cycles. None of these existing data features are locked behind a paywall; however,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636211/garmin-connect-plus-subscription-wearables" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Garmin recently introduced a premium tier</a>&nbsp;that provides personalized AI-powered insights and additional features for $6.99 a month (or $69.99 a year).</p>
<p>One note: there is a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23982519/garmin-venu-3s-review-smartwatch-sleep-tracking-wearable">Venu 3</a>, which adds a newer heart rate sensor and nap detection. I liked it quite a bit, and it ticks off a lot of the right boxes — except for price. It’s $450, which puts it outside what I’d consider ideal for casual users. The other option is Garmin’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24107020/garmin-forerunner-165-music-review-smartwatch-wearables">Forerunner 165</a> — it’s a $249 budget training watch that’s quite similar to the Venu Sq 2 feature-wise, albeit with a sportier vibe. Basically, go with what you find on sale. I firmly believe older models are still a good choice if all you want is the fitness-tracking basics. This is especially true since newer software updates often make their way to older Garmins. Garmin users also tend to hang onto their devices for a good while. Strava’s 2023 year-end survey found that the most popular smartwatch among its users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/3/24024332/strava-users-are-still-hangin-onto-their-old-garmins">was an eight-year-old Garmin</a>!</p>

<p>Garmin’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22937154/garmin-fenix-7s-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch">flagship Fenix 7 series</a> is no joke, and the Fenix 7 Pro lineup takes it up a notch. It’s got built-in multiband GPS, solar charging on all models, the option of touchscreen or button navigation, topographical maps, and oodles upon oodles of data. Plus, every Fenix 7 Pro model has a hands-free LED flashlight, an upgraded heart rate sensor, and an improved memory-in-pixel display that’s slightly easier to read in low lighting.</p>
<p>Garmin wearables are also known for providing extensive in-depth metrics, and the Fenix 7 Pro lineup<strong> </strong>is no exception. You get excellent recovery metrics as well as helpful training guides and coaching programs. The best part is that Garmin doesn’t charge extra for those features. That’s good news, as these are expensive watches.</p>
<p>I appreciate how quickly these Fenix 7 watches can pick up a GPS signal. That’s a must if you’re training in the dead of winter. These watches can also take a beating. All models are built to military-grade standards and feature up to 10ATM of water resistance. That means they’re more than capable of a dunk in the ocean.</p>

<p>Although the screen is brighter, <a href="https://os.mbed.com/teams/JapanDisplayInc/wiki/MIP-reflective-color-display">MIP displays</a> still aren’t my absolute favorite — the OLED on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22934516/garmin-epix-2-review">Garmin Epix 2</a> and the Epix Pro<strong> </strong>are much easier on the eyes. It’s admittedly tough to pick between the Fenix 7, Fenix 7 Pro, Epix 2, and Epix Pro lineups — especially now that the Epix Pro also has great battery life, the LED flashlight, and now comes in multiple sizes. What it boils down to is whether you prioritize a brighter display, longer battery life, or price.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer the Epix Pro for better readability, but the Fenix 7 Pro is the better choice if this is your first introduction to Garmin’s platform. You’ll get better battery life, the same LED flashlight, all the same training features, and a lower starting price.

<p>Technically, there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24228712/garmin-fenix-8-enduro-3-smartwatch-wearables"><strong>the</strong> Fenix 8 series</a> on the block. That said, I still think the standard Fenix 7 or 7 Pro lineup is the better overall value. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266434/garmin-fenix-8-review-smartwatch-wearables-fitness-tracking">Fenix 8</a> adds diving features and voice assistant capabilities, but it also ups the standard Fenix 7’s starting price of $650 by an additional $350. That’s tough to swallow, especially since retailers may offer discounts on older models to get rid of existing inventory.</p>

<p>The vast majority of fitness trackers are worn on the wrist, but the $349 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268024/oura-ring-4-review-smart-rings-wearables">Oura Ring</a> isn’t. The smart ring is a good option for people who are looking for something a little more discreet. It’s also less distracting than some other wrist-based options, as it lacks a screen and doesn’t mirror push notifications from your phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Oura Ring 4 isn’t functionally that much different from the previous Gen 3. It’s slimmer, features a all-titanium design, has improved battery life, and has an updated sensor algorithm that Oura says is more accurate. None of these software features are gatekept to the Ring 4, so Gen 3 owners shouldn’t feel the need to upgrade unless their ring no longer lasts more than two days on a single charge. That said, the fourth-gen ring has an expanded size range spanning from 4 to 15. If you felt your Gen 3 was a bit snug or couldn’t find a size that fit right, you may have a better option now.</p>

<p>While smaller than your average wearable, the Oura Ring still tracks a ton of metrics, including heart rate variability, body temperature, blood oxygen, all-day heart rate monitoring, and cycle tracking. Since launching, the Oura Ring has also added activity tracking, blood oxygen levels, chronotypes to help visualize your circadian rhythms, a social feature called Circles, improved stress tracking, and cardiovascular age and capacity metrics. More recently, it’s added an AI chatbot, meal logging, and glucose tracking, though you&#8217;ll have to purchase <a href="https://ouraring.com/product/dexcom/stelo-glucose-biosensor/">a $99 Dexcom Stelo CGM</a> to take advantage of the latter. It’s rolled out a more accurate <a href="https://ouraring.com/blog/developing-ouras-latest-sleep-staging-algorithm/">sleep stages algorithm</a> as well, and the app has been entirely revamped to better organize these features and metrics.</p>
<p>The Oura Ring tracks typical metrics — such as steps and calories burned —&nbsp; but its main focus is sleep and recovery. Each day, you’re given three sets of scores for your readiness, sleep, and activity. It’s a simple, holistic look at your overall wellness and an ideal pick if you want a more hands-off experience with your data.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a Samsung Galaxy Watch, you may want to consider the $399.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24205156/samsung-galaxy-ring-review-smart-ring-wearables">Galaxy Ring</a>. It’s a bit more expensive than the base Oura Ring, but it doesn’t come with a subscription, and you get much better battery life when used with the Galaxy Watch. The hardware is also excellent, especially the charging case. That said, this is only an option for Android users, and even then, you don’t unlock its full potential unless you’ve got other Samsung gear. I also recommend the $349 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ULTRAHUMAN-AIR-Smart-Health-Tracker-Fitness/dp/B0D983R3N3">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> for folks who don’t like the idea of Oura’s monthly subscription.</p>

<p>It’s truly hard to beat the Amazfit Band 7’s $49.99 price — doubly so since you can often find it on sale for even less. Wearing the Band 7 feels like a throwback to 2014, which is great if all you’re looking for is a simple and casual tracker that won’t break the bank.</p>
<p>No one is going to compliment you on the Band 7’s design, but it’s got a handful of cute watch faces that make good use of its OLED touchscreen. And despite having an OLED display, you’ll still get roughly 14 days of battery life on a single charge. It’s also incredibly lightweight, making it a good option for sleep tracking as well.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24477148/236555_Amazfit_Band_7_AKrales_0088.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Amazfit Band 7 with colorful clock face worn on woman’s wrist." title="Amazfit Band 7 with colorful clock face worn on woman’s wrist." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The Amazfit Band 7 won’t turn heads, but it’s the type of capable yet affordable fitness band that’s much harder to find nowadays.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge" data-portal-copyright="Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge" />
<p>You also get an absurd number of features for the price. That includes Amazon Alexa, continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen monitoring, stress tracking, advanced sleep tracking, training metrics like VO2 max and load, abnormal heart rate alerts, menstrual tracking, push notifications, find my phone, a camera remote, and even a Pomodoro timer. You’re sacrificing contactless payments and will have to settle for tethered GPS, but this is a fair tradeoff considering everything else you’re getting. It’s not the best option for hardcore fitness tracking, but this is a great option if all you’re looking to do is casually track activity and your steps.</p>
<p>Amazfit’s been making surprisingly good budget trackers for a while. That said, if you’re a little wary of a lesser-known brand, the $159.95 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23958997/fitbit-charge-6-review-fitness-tracker-side-button">Fitbit Charge 6</a> is a decent alternative. It’s pricier, but you get a lot of what Amazfit is missing. That includes Google services like YouTube Music, Google Wallet, and Google Maps. Plus, it has built-in GPS and the ability to broadcast your heart rate with some Bluetooth-compatible gym equipment.</p>

<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;37mm with 18mm straps  /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;45g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 39 days /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp; OLED display /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;Tethered GPS /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</em></em></p>
<p>The $249.95 Withings ScanWatch Light is a fetching hybrid analog smartwatch. Think of it as a dressier fitness band with some Swatch-like design sensibilities. It’s got all your basics like simple push notifications, timers, and alarms. Plus, you can track steps, sleep, menstrual cycles, and GPS activities straight from the wrist. It looks spiffy on the wrist, and if you like a pop of color, Withings offers minty green and pale blue color options. It’s also got excellent battery life, with an estimated 30 days on a single charge. I got a little less in testing at around 25 days, but that’s still much better than the vast majority of flagship smartwatches. This also looks way more stylish than beefier multisport watches with similar battery life.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the Light is a pared-down version of the $369.95 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Withings-ScanWatch-Monitor-Health-Smartwatch/dp/B0CG9P8YFW">ScanWatch 2</a>. The main things you’re missing are an EKG sensor for atrial fibrillation detection, a temperature sensor, blood oxygen tracking, and an altimeter for tracking elevation. For basic fitness tracking, you don’t really need those sensors. That’s why I think the extra $100 in savings is worth it for the Light, especially since both are lacking in safety features, contactless payments, and some other bells and whistles you can get from other watches in the $350 price range. That said, if you want extras, the ScanWatch 2 also gets you a slightly more elegant look thanks to the second step-counter dial.</p>

<p>Another option I like is the $179.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22882401/garmin-vivomove-sport-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch-wearables">Garmin Vivomove Sport</a>, which actually dominated this category in the past few years. It’s hard to beat the price, especially since it gets you access to Garmin’s platform. However, Garmin’s “hidden” OLED display can get washed out in bright lighting, and battery life was significantly shorter than other hybrid analog watches at around five days. Still, if you’d prefer a platform with a focus on fitness rather than wellness, the Vivomove Sport may be the better move over a Withings watch.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a smartwatch that does fitness well, then iPhone owners need to look no further than the $399 Apple Watch Series 10. (The LTE version costs $50 more.) This is another iterative update, but the Series 10 is a much more comfortable watch than previous models. It’s thinner and lighter, plus there’s a larger display. If you’ve got a Series 5 or older, now is a good time to upgrade.</p>
<p>WatchOS 11, which was released in September 2024, included a<strong> </strong>suite of training features. There’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/15/24195983/watchos-11-preview-training-load-vitals-fitness">Training Load</a>, which gives you greater insight into how intensely you’ve been working out the past week compared to the last 28 days. There’s also a Vitals app that flags when key metrics, like sleep duration or heart rate, may be out of whack. Plus, you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24175506/apple-watch-watchos-11-rest-days-wearables">finally pause your rings</a> for rest days. The software update also brought some savvy updates to the Smart Stack. For example, if you’re in a noisy cafe wondering what song’s playing, the Smart Stack can surface the Shazaam widget. It also supports Live Activities, turning your wrist into a mini Dynamic Island. Health-wise, we also have FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection.</p>
<p>Apple announced new fitness features that will be available in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679225/apple-watchos-26-wwdc-features">watchOS 26</a> (out this fall), which the Series 10 and other recent models will support. To name some highlights coming, the Workout app has been redesigned with corner buttons that serve as shortcuts. There’s also a new Apple Intelligence feature called “Workout Buddy,” which generates a persona to give you pep talks, insights, and advice based on your fitness data. Workout Buddy will only be available if you have an iPhone that’s compatible with Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro or newer) nearby and if you’re wearing Bluetooth headphones. For more details about WatchOS 26, you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/710780/watchos-26-preview-apple-intelligence-workout-buddy-smart-stack-wrist-flick">can read my overview</a> of the first public beta.</p>
<p>Of course, we also have to address <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24009254/apple-watch-itc-ban-patent-dispute">the Apple Watch ban</a>. As of January 18th, 2024, new Apple Watches sold in the US have the blood oxygen feature disabled due to an ongoing patent battle with medical device maker Masimo. This isn’t a huge deal for most people, as this feature isn’t that useful for most people yet, and the sleep apnea feature exclusively uses the accelerometer rather than the blood oxygen sensor. You might want to consider a refurbished Series 7 or 8 if blood oxygen sensing is important to you, however.</p>
<p>If you’re a first-time buyer, you may want to opt for the second-gen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch">Apple Watch SE</a>. It’s slightly cheaper at $249, and while you don’t get as many features, it’s a good introduction to the ecosystem. Otherwise, if you’re the type of athlete who covets a Garmin, you may also want to consider splurging on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. It’s more expensive at $799, but it has the brightest screen of any Apple Watch, comes with dual-frequency GPS, has diving and hiking safety features, and is made of more durable materials. </p>

<p>Truthfully, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra left me a bit disappointed after reviewing it — not because it’s a bad piece of hardware, but because it copies a bit too much from Apple. Even so, this is the most full-featured fitness smartwatch a Samsung phone owner can buy.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Samsung recently released the Galaxy Watch 8, with an all-new squircle design that may seem controversial at first, but allowed Samsung to make the smartwatch slimmer than its predecessor. It also sits flatter against your skin, which made it more comfortable to wear. I preferred the Galaxy Watch 7 over the Ultra for casual fitness tracking and wearability, and that’s still true with the Watch 8, but the improvements over the previous generation aren’t significant. Its battery is barely bigger, and its brighter screen (up to 3,000 nits vs. 2,000) didn’t make a big difference even in direct sunlight.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a new Vascular Load feature, which measures how stressed your vascular system <em>is</em> while you sleep, but it doesn’t give a reason why this metric is important. Its Antioxidant Index, which gauges whether you’ve eaten enough fruits and vegetables, can help<strong> </strong>encourage you to eat more healthily when creating a new diet. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In testing, the sensor works by using blue, yellow, and infrared LEDs to pick up the carotenoid levels in your skin. Carotenoids are an antioxidant that gives fruits and vegetables their color. The sensor could be fooled by pressing any colorful objects — a piece of broccoli, blackberry (which exploded), marker-colored finger, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/713172/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-antioxidant-index-cheezits">Cheeze-It</a> — against it. I did find its Running Coach feature, which creates a training regimen based on your performance after a 12-minute run, to be helpful. Its assessment of my current fitness level was fair, and the workouts it suggested were well-structured.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As far as AI is concerned, the Galaxy Watch 8 has Google Gemini, which was hit or miss in my testing. It couldn’t send a message in Slack, and the K-pop-inspired running playlist it created had a few songs outside that genre, but<a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/713532/gemini-wear-os-pixel-watch-hands-on"> it’s handy</a> if you want to use Google’s AI on your wrist rather than taking out your phone. Google Gemini support is one feature of One UI 8 (Samsung’s fork of Wear OS 6, Google’s latest wearable operating system), which also includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661483/google-leak-material-3-expressive-android-design">Material 3 Expressive</a>, a redesign optimized for circular watches. Live updates, which let you track things like deliveries, rideshares, and information from navigation apps, will also be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/673808/google-io-wallet-wearos-play-store">coming in 2026</a>. Samsung’s One UI 8 also came to the Galaxy Watch Ultra as a <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-now-has-one-ui-8-watch/">software update</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, there’s still a significant gap between the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Ultra in my testing as far as accuracy, especially for GPS tracking. And<strong> </strong>what really sealed the deal for me was the difference in battery life. (The gaps are much less egregious between the base Apple Watch and Ultra 2.) The caveat is, if all you want is casual fitness tracking, the Galaxy Watch 8 is the better choice for wearability. It’s just more comfortable for sleep tracking and lighter overall. Just keep in mind it lacks the Ultra’s emergency siren and shortcut button.</p>
<p>Both watches have the same processor, a 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor, some AI health features, and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. The hardware in both current-generation Galaxy smartwatches makes for a more future-proof purchase, but I found the AI health features to be hit-or-miss in practice. As always, some features, like EKGs and sleep apnea detection, are limited to Samsung owners. That makes this hard to wholeheartedly recommend this to non-Samsung Android users.</p>

<p>With the Pixel Watch 3, Google is finally done playing catch-up.</p>
<p>There are truly too many updates to call each one out individually, but overall, they fall into two buckets: refinement and expansion. The hardware is mostly the same as the Pixel Watch 2 in terms of design. However, we now have a brighter screen, smaller bezels, and a new 45mm size. The larger size is quite nice, especially if you prefer larger screens without sacrificing wearability.</p>
<p>Battery life is also better. There’s a new battery-saver mode that kicks in when you hit 15 percent, and the new displays are also more power efficient. Plus, bedtime mode is automatic now, so that helps the watch last longer overnight for sleep tracking. It’s only a modest improvement over the Pixel Watch 2, but it’s dramatic compared to the original.</p>

<p>Software is where the Pixel Watch 3 makes the most updates. There are a ton of new fitness and health features, including a new running dashboard, custom running workouts, and AI-generated workout suggestions. There’s also a revamped Daily Readiness Score and a new Cardio Load metric, which gauges how intensely you’ve been exercising. If you’re located <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619929/google-pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-fda-clerance-smartwatch">in the US</a> or Europe, you can also take advantage Google’s new Loss of Pulse feature, which calls emergency services on your behalf if it detects you no longer have a pulse.</p>
<p>The Pixel Watch 3 also better integrates with Google services and the Pixel ecosystem. You can now view your Nest Doorbell or Camera feed straight from the wrist — and it’s quite handy if you get a lot of packages or guests. If you have Google TV, you can use the watch as a remote. Now that the watch has an ultra wideband chip, it can also now unlock your Pixel phone. You can also use the Recorder app to capture audio and send it straight to your Pixel phone.</p>
<p>That said, some of these features now mean the Pixel Watch works best with a Pixel phone. If you’re looking for alternatives to Google and Samsung, the $329.99 <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/global/oneplus-watch-3">OnePlus Watch 3</a> was released on July 8th. We’ve gone <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/612965/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on-smartwatch-wearables">hands-on</a> with the smartwatch and are pleased that it finally has a rotating crown, larger brighter display, better battery life, and faster charging.

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Whoop MG isn’t a huge departure from the Whoop 4.0, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22957195/whoop-review-fitness-tracker-wearables">I reviewed previously</a>, but it’s still the best choice for elite athletes. Its buckle still annoyed me, and bands from the previous generation are incompatible with this model, though Whoop will give you a credit for trading in your current bands. Its processor is 60 percent faster but I didn’t feel any difference in day-to-day use, save for faster data syncing with Whoop’s app. I did notice the bump in battery life from five to 14 hours, Whoop’s redesigned app, and a handful of new health and wellness features.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A key part of the Whoop MG’s appeal is the dense daily reports on your health and wellness accessible within its app. They verge on overwhelming, with an emphasis on how much activities have strained your body. The new Whoop Coach (an AI-powered chatbot) summarizes information about your sleep duration, activity, and heart rate to give you advice on hitting the fitness goals you selected during setup. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, a feature called Healthspan calculates your Whoop Age based on three weeks worth of sleep, exercise, steps, VO2 Max, heart rate, and lean body mass data. It’ll update your Whoop Age weekly after its first assessment, but be mindful that it discounts factors like genetics, your environment, and lifestyle, which significantly impact the rate your body actually ages. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Whoop MG has an FDA-cleared EKG reader, and can send you notifications if it detects atrial fibrillation. It can also give you blood pressure insights, but is currently in beta. Whoop Advanced Labs is an upcoming service that will let you send in a blood test to be reviewed by clinicians to give you even more health insights. If you like the distraction-free design of a smart ring, but want your wearable on your wrist instead of your finger, consider the Whoop MG.  </p>

==================================================
Lenovo’s rollable laptop is the coolest computer I’ve used all year
ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 review: a $3,300 CES concept you can own.
Photography by Amelia Holowaty Krales
Part of me still can’t believe it, but Lenovo did the thing: it took a bonkers concept for a laptop with a rollable screen and built the tech into something you can actually own and use like a normal computer. Except, as conventional as the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 can be, it’s far from a normal computer. It’s a $3,300 laptop with a screen that expands from 14 inches to 16.7 inches at the push of a button.
Oh, and it’s actually good. Not just good, but very good. I still can’t believe it.
The expanding screen is genuinely useful, and it makes the ThinkBook by far one of the coolest and most futuristic-looking laptops I’ve ever used. But, as with most new technologies, being at the bleeding edge is costly. And as you might expect for a laptop that physically gets taller, there are some growing pains, too.
Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 rollable
One of the coolest, most unique laptops aroundThe tall screen is great for productivity and eye-level video callsPunchy colors and crisp, bright details from the flexible OLEDTop-tier keyboard and trackpadGreat performance and battery life
$3,300Heavy for its sizeLimited hinge tilt and limited portsLenovo’s multitasking software isn’t greatThe non-touch screen wobbles, creaks, and has visible ripples
When you first open the ThinkBook Plus, you’ll see a square-ish 14 inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a 2000x1600 resolution. But press a button, and the screen unrolls to a taller 16.7-inches and 2000 x 2350 resolution. (I affectionately call it “the tallboy.”) With the screen extended, it’s like working with two stacked 12.4-inch 16:9 displays. It’s some of the best single-monitor multitasking I’ve experienced. The extra vertical space is great for going full-screen in a document, code editor, or spreadsheet, or for split-screening apps without cutting off the sides of the windows. You can get the benefits of a vertical display anywhere, not just in a multi-monitor desk setup. And the ThinkBook itself makes a great vertical sidecar to a big monitor.
Component report card:
Tallboy mode even makes video calls more pleasant, since it brings the webcam much closer to eye level. Having the top of the screen higher has also helped relieve a bit of neck pain from staring down at laptops all day. I get improved ergonomics whether I’m working at my desk, a table, or in goblin mode on my floor.
I’ve been using the new ThinkBook Plus full-time for about a week, and I’ve kept it in 16.7-inch mode almost the entire time, because that’s the whole point of this thing. I never get sick of looking at this giant OLED with its punchy colors and strong contrast. It’s plastic instead of glass for the sake of flexibility, and it lacks touch support (though that also means less chance of scratching its softer surface with a fingernail or accidentally knocking it over with a tap). But I don’t mind any of that, because having so much screen real estate in a laptop this compact and portable was unreal up until now.
As with a foldable phone, you can see some creases and ripples in the screen’s lower third — the part that rolls up — especially at oblique angles. If I look closely while working on a bright-white document, I can sometimes make out a faint shadowy strip, but I rarely see it, even when staring at that spot. The motorized screen takes about eight seconds to extend or retract, and it’s no louder than the fans on an average gaming laptop. People right near you in a quiet space will hear it, but even ambient sounds like a TV in the background easily mask the motor.
Lenovo had to go to some lengths to accommodate this screen while keeping the ThinkBook looking and feeling like a normal-ish laptop. Its chassis is aluminum instead of the carbon fiber, magnesium, and plastic found in the ThinkPad X1 Carbon — one of Lenovo’s go-to models of productivity / business laptops. That makes the ThinkBook pretty heavy for its size: at 3.72 pounds, it’s a whole pound and a half heavier than the X1 Carbon and a pound heavier than a 13-inch MacBook Air. The extra weight is likely necessary to keep the laptop from falling over backward when the screen is extended. The hinge is also very stiff. It takes two hands to pry open the laptop from its closed position, and the hinge doesn’t tilt back nearly as far as other laptops to prevent toppling. The limited range of motion is less of a big deal in tall mode, but more noticeable in 14-inch mode. However, I usually put it in 14-inch mode only when it’s time to close it up and move it around, so it hasn’t bothered me much yet.
Despite the laptop’s general sturdiness, the screen itself can be a little wobbly, with audible creaks and slight knocking sounds when you’re adjusting it. The lid consists of an inner frame and outer frame; the outer frame moves along a track on the edges of the inner frame to expand the lid’s footprint and roll the screen upward. The irksome sounds come from where the two lid frames meet in the middle.
Because part of the screen is garaged under the keyboard deck, there’s no space next to the keyboard for the speakers, so instead they’re at the front of the chassis, angled down. They’re mediocre for a $3,300 laptop, and the sound is often obscured by your wrists.
The other audible quirk is the ThinkBook’s “you’re doing it wrong” alarm: If you start closing the lid with the screen extended, or you move the screen while it’s rolling, the laptop emits a high-pitched tone. It’s the most 90s-motherboard-ass thing I’ve heard in a long time, but I find its needling sound oddly charming.
The rest of the laptop is solid, as you’d hope for a $3,300 machine. It has a haptic trackpad (hallelujah). Despite being slightly small, it beats the heck out of all the Lenovo mechanical trackpads I’ve tried, rivaling Apple’s in precision and feel. It’s a great counterpart to the keyboard, which is excellent as usual for Lenovo, with a great tactile feel and good key travel. The built-in mic sounds good, and that high-climbing webcam renders a fairly sharp image. It handles mixed or difficult lighting well, while capturing you at a more pleasing angle. (Look, it’s okay not to want your webcam to accentuate double chins or give people a view up your nostrils.) It’s a shame it only has two Thunderbolt 4 ports, but bigger port crimes have been committed elsewhere, and at least there’s a headphone jack.
Lenovo ships the ThinkBook Plus with its own Workspace app to help with multitasking on the oddly proportioned display. It offers quick access to pinnable widgets, apps, and even enabling a virtual display for a picture-in-picture experience — if you’re so inclined . You can choose to have Workspace auto-launch when you expand the screen, and there’s even a dedicated key for it. But I found it more troublesome than helpful, and I encountered bugs when using Workspace with multiple virtual desktops, ranging from glitching my wallpaper to preventing me from four-finger swiping between desktops. Instead, I’ve just been using Windows 11’s native window management, and I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how well it works on this shapeshifting screen. I encountered a one-off bug where the taskbar randomly disappeared, but it was solved by a full restart.
Performance-wise, the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V in the ThinkBook lines up with other laptops we’ve tested with the same chip. It’s fast for everyday tasks and productivity apps, and it’s about as power efficient as other models with much smaller, non-OLED screens. I could easily last nine hours or longer on a charge with the default sleep / power settings, getting me through a full day of work in mixed usage (Google Docs, Slack, Signal chat, lots of Chrome tabs, and even a 30-minute video call and equally long audio call). And that whole time I rarely heard its fan spin up or felt it heat up. On another day, I stretched it to nearly eight full hours with the screen kept on nearly the whole time in tall mode.
Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 / Intel Core Ultra 7 258V 8C / 32GB / 1TB
Acer Swift 14 AI / Intel Core Ultra 7 258V 8C / 32GB / 1TB
Microsoft Surface Laptop 13.8-inch / Snapdragon X Plus 10C / 16GB / 512GB
MacBook Air 13-inch M4 / 10C / 10C / 16GB / 512GB
MacBook Pro 16-inch M4 Pro / 14C / 20C / 48GB / 2TB
Fun fact: draining the battery to below five percent activates a countdown timer for the screen to automatically roll down and stay down until it turns off or you plug in. So you shouldn’t get stuck with the screen extended and no way to pack it up. Not bad, Lenovo. Not bad.
$3,300 can get you a lot of other excellent laptops (three great $1,000 laptops, even), but none of them have this extending display. It’s one of only a few ways to get more screen in a conventionally sized laptop. You can get a dual-screen laptop like the Yoga Book 9i or Asus Zenbook Duo, or a folding-screen laptop like the ThinkPad X1 Fold , or opt for some kind of portable monitor. But as much as I dig those, a dual-screen or folding-screen setup is so cumbersome by comparison. You’re not just strolling into a coffee shop and hitting a button to get more screen, you’re setting up camp with your Franken-multi-monitor-laptop and its peripherals.
The ThinkBook Plus has seemed pretty durable in my time with it. I even had it rattling around in a backpack on a 500-mile road trip, and it was fine. Lenovo claims the screen is rated for 30,000 hinge openings / closings and 20,000 rolls up and down, but you just don’t have those concerns with regular laptops. As much as I love using this rollable laptop, I’ll always be a little wary about longevity and what a screen repair may cost if the worst ever happens (Lenovo did not answer my questions about repair costs by the time of publication).
The ThinkBook Plus rollable is a genuinely cool idea, and a great laptop. I hope the display tech continues to evolve and we see more wild ideas like this become a reality. Or, if Lenovo delivers on its other recent concept laptop idea, the ThinkBook Flip, maybe we can get a similar tall-monitor experience without the added heft and cost of motors.
This could be the start of a rolling-screen revolution. Or it could just be a niche product for deep-pocketed folks who want to feel like they’re living in the future. Sadly, one of these realities is much more likely for now, until the tech gets cheap enough to trickle down to mainstream laptops. But damn am I happy this thing is out in the real world, even if spotting one at a random cafe will feel like a unicorn sighting. Lenovo is one of the only laptop manufacturers that turns its weird concepts into actual products, and I hope it keeps pushing — getting cheaper, quirkier, or ideally both.
