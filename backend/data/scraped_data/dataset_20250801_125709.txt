Climate Change Solutions: From Carbon Capture to Renewable Energy
Most Read Stories Today
Climate Change is a pressing global issue, driven by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), resulting from human activities. This demands urgent action without fundamentally altering how we generate and utilize energy, and safeguarding the environment.
The world population is predicted to reach about 9.9 billion by 2050, (IISD, 2020), with over 80% increase in energy demand (IEA, 2020). Countries worldwide are increasingly adopting alternate energy sources, transitioning to Renewable Energy such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power, by storing or repurposing captured carbon, to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. (Hassan et al., 2024).
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), Potentials, and Challenges.
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a technology designed to reduce CO2 emissions from industrial processes and power plants by capturing CO2 at the source and storing it underground. The captured CO2 is then transported to storage sites in geological formations where it can be securely sequestered. This process provides a pragmatic solution for transitioning to low-carbon economies without entirely dismantling current energy systems. The CCS technology has demonstrated considerable potential in reducing global CO2 emissions by at least 19%, by 2050. (IEA, 2020).
Despite its potential, CCS faces several challenges, especially of high cost of capturing and storing the CO2, which is estimated at $50 to $100 per ton. The process also requires extensive infrastructure for transportation and storage, posing logistical challenges. (Global CCS Institute, 2021). These included concerns over the long-term security of the stored CO2, with the risk of leakage potentially undermining its overall benefits.
Transitioning Of Renewable Energy Sources And Its Impact On Climate Change.
Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, harness natural processes to generate electricity without producing greenhouse gases. The effectiveness of renewable energy in mitigating climate change is well-documented, and these sources are pivotal to transitioning towards a sustainable and low-carbon energy system.
For instance, a study by Jacobson et al. (2017) demonstrated that transitioning to 100% renewable energy could significantly reduce global CO2 emissions, decrease air pollution, and improve public health.
There is also exponential growth in the scalability of renewable energy, driven by declining costs and technological advancements. Although the cost of solar photovoltaics (PV) has declined by 89% since 2010, while the onshore wind energy costs have fallen by 69% during the same period (LCOE, 2023), the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy is still discussed as a major concern, raised by reliability issues.
In contrast, energy storage solutions, such as batteries have been presented to address this challenge, but somewhat add up to the overall cost and complexity of the renewable energy systems. The environmental impact of manufacturing and disposing of renewable energy infrastructure, such as solar panels and wind turbines, cannot also be overlooked.
Integration of Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) and Renewable Energy.
Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) provides a reliable backup for intermittent renewable energy sources, ensuring a steady supply of low-carbon electricity. Conversely, the growth of renewable energy can reduce the overall demand for CCS, making it more feasible and cost-effective to deploy in sectors where emissions are hardest to abate, such as heavy industry and aviation.
Artificial Intelligence in Energy Efficiency.
The global energy sector often faced with increasing challenges and rising demands, as well as efficiency concerns and lack of necessary analytics for effective management.
AI-driven solutions can transform energy operations across numerous industries and assist in addressing complex challenges in various sectors, including education, agriculture, healthcare, energy, and manufacturing (EMRC, 2023).
In smart grids, for instance, AI-driven Sensors and Real-time data analysis can be used to integrate renewable energy sources into existing energy infrastructure to balance supply and demand. This allows consumers to adjust their energy usage based on real-time pricing or grid conditions.
Use Of AI To Harness and Optimize Clean Energy Sources.
1. Machine Learning Algorithms: AI can analyze vast amount of data with speed and precision using weather patterns, generation, consumption, and equipment performance to make real-time decisions based on its predictive capabilities. For instance, AI models can be used to maximize energy capture by automating and adjusting the solar panels or the pitch of the wind turbine blades.
2. Weather Forecasting: AI learning models can forecast solar and wind energy generation accurately based on historical data and meteorological factors to enable grid operators to anticipate fluctuations in the energy supply. This is essential in efficient energy transition and stability without much energy wastage.
3. Energy Production and Storage Optimization: AI in renewable energy empower systems to learn from data, adapt, and improve over time to coordinate energy generation, storage, and distribution. AI enhances the storage of excess energy generated during peak periods to be used when the generation is extremely low, enhancing resilience and reliability. For example, In microgrid management, AI can be used to analyze energy consumption patterns to identify areas for energy savings.
Policy, Investment, and Economic Considerations.
Effective policy frameworks and economic incentives are crucial to the successful deployment of both AI and CCS. Governments play a vital role in creating an enabling environment through regulations, subsidies, and carbon pricing mechanisms. The European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is an example of a successful policy initiative that has incentivized the adoption of low-carbon technologies, including CCS and renewable energy (European Commission, 2020).
There is also need for international cooperation to bridge the gap between regions with varying levels of technological advancement and economic development. Developed countries need to support developing nations by providing financial aid, technology transfer, and capacity-building initiatives.
Carbon capture and renewable energy are two critical solutions with the potential to significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. As the world embraces renewable energy to combat climate change, AI emerges as a significant vehicle to achieve a greener and more sustainable energy future.
While the potential benefits of AI in the energy sector are undeniably compelling, if supported by effective policies and international cooperation; their integration to anticipate ecological consequences will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions that minimize harm to ecosystems and wildlife.
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the renewable energy sector can empower energy companies with unprecedented precision and efficiency. This, not only benefits energy providers by enhancing productivity, but also makes a substantial contribution to global efforts to combat climate change.

Climate change and its impact on the environment and human health have become alarming concerns in recent years. The use of traditional energy sources such as coal, oil, and gas is a major contributor to the rise in carbon dioxide emissions, which is the primary driving force behind climate change. As a result, significant efforts have been made to develop more sustainable and efficient methods of using carbon-based resources to reduce net carbon dioxide emissions. This review delves into the latest advanced techniques for converting carbon dioxide into high-value chemical products and renewable energy. By employing these innovative approaches, remarkable progress can be made towards enhancing the environment and promoting economic growth, ultimately leading to carbon neutrality.

Water Scarcity and Artificial Rainfall: The Positive and The Negative Effects of Cloud Seeding, including Health Hazards and Climate Implications.
Most Read Stories Today
Globally, over 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water due to scarcity, including sanitation and hygiene services.
Climate change is one of the factors exacerbating the issue of lack of equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation, particularly in rural and remote areas, leading to increased health complications for older people, individuals with disabilities, and children.
According to Samantha Stratton-Short, —UNOPS Head of Strategic Initiatives, “Climate change, conflicts, and water pollution are widening the gap to ensuring clean water and sanitation for all, especially for women and marginalized groups.”
Artificial Rainfall is a scientific weather modification technique, in which silver iodide is used to generate or enhance more rainfall to augment sufficient water supplies in arid regions and combat droughts. However, it is still a scientific process engulfed with a complex web of risks and health uncertainties.
There are many safety concerns, especially on flooding, ecosystems, and biodiversity. These concerns were focused on human health and its implications for our changing climate, as part of its potential downside.
Cloud seeding involves infusing clouds with silver iodide particles to stimulate condensation and precipitation. While it has been used for decades, recent interest has resurfaced due to worsening water shortages and climate-related disruptions.
What is Silver Iodine?
Silver iodide is a chemical compound composed of silver and iodine that has been used in the production of agricultural pesticides, antiseptics in medicine, cloud seeding, and as a yellowish-white powder used in photography, as a pigment. It's also used in manufacturing certain types of glass and is sometimes found in some air pollution control devices. The AgI is slightly soluble in water and is more toxic than silver.
Silver iodide (AgI) is considered the most common nucleating material used in cloud seeding. Many studies concluded that AgI are too low to induce a toxicological effect because they only remain in soils and sediments for some time, but emphasized cumulative environmental effects from continuous practice.
As early as 1965, the National Science Foundation called for research into the human consequences of weather modification. Unfortunately, these concerns remain under-explored.
The silver iodide used in cloud seeding raises questions about its impact on human health and is linked to numerous health risks such as toxicity, reproductive disorders, developmental defects, and cancer. When oxidized, may also lead to Iodism, a type of poisoning caused by iodine, causing skin rashes, headaches, and respiratory issues. Prolonged exposure to silver iodide can cause argyria, a condition that causes the human tissues to turn blue or gray when too much of it is deposited in the body.
The silver ion is also known to inhibit glutathione peroxidase and Sodium-Potassium ions- ATPase activity, disrupting and reducing chemical reactions, oxidation, and intracellular ion concentrations. These nanoparticles are believed to disrupt the mitochondrial respiratory chain, causing oxidative stress, reduced ATP synthesis, and DNA damage.

Cloud seeding introduces potentially harmful chemicals (AgI) into the atmosphere. While proponents claim little evidence of harm, the long-term effects remain uncertain. These chemicals, once exposed to the environment, the particles spread and pollute the atmosphere.
There is also a growing concern about carbon dioxide masking, underlying the sensitivity of our climate to rising carbon dioxide levels. For instance, If pre-industrial cloud cover was higher than previously thought, the masking effect may have been overestimated, affecting climate projections.
THE CLIMATE IMPLICATIONS
1. Cloud Cover and Cooling: Historically, scientists assumed that pre-industrial skies were sunnier, but recent experiments challenge this notion. The clouds play a vital role in regulating solar energy. Increased cloud cover reflects sunlight back into space, contributing to an overall cooling effect.
2. Rain Enhancement Research Programs: The Advancement of rain enhancement science projects such as nanotechnology and cloud seeding are projects embarked on to maximize water vapor condensation and rainfall, aiming to secure water supplies and mitigate the effects of climate change.
For example, in 2016, the UAE Presidential Court launched a global research initiative, and the UAE Research Program for Rain Enhancement Science (UAEREP), under the administration of the National Center of Meteorology (NCM), to address the critical issue of water security in the field of rain enhancement.
The UAEREP funded millions of dollars for research projects, ongoing training programs, and capacity building involving worldwide scientists and scientific institutions, contributing to global efforts in water resource management, climate adaptation, and sustainable development. The UAE has been involved in cloud-seeding operations since the late 1990s.
In November 2023, a four-year pilot joint project was also launched in the US with an aim to increase precipitation from 5% to 15% by the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority (SAWPA), from five water districts by the Eastern Municipal Water District, Inland Empire Utilities Agency, Orange County Water District, San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District and Western Municipal Water District.
The SAWPA is the state-approved Regional Water Management group that brings together the watershed community and serves as a Joint Powers Authority for addressing regional water issues, to reduce imported, more expensive, and less reliable sources of drinking water in the region. The project was aimed at increasing local water production by up to 40 percent and supporting its member agencies for long-term restoration of their degraded environment.
Cloud seeding offers hope for water-scarce regions, but remains a double-edged sword that requires rigorous research, transparency, and consideration of associated health risks.
It's essential to weigh in the benefits and the risks, to ensure that our silver bullets do not inadvertently harm the very communities we aim to develop. As they say, every cloud has its shadow; therefore, it will be wise to make sure the one we have above us is not a toxic one.
